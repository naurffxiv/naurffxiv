### Helpful Macros
- P1  Setup Macro

[Vault Knights PlayStation Macro](
https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/27408312/blog/5009018/)

This is also the orientation of markers you'll use in P5 PlayStation 2. It looks like this in-game:

```
D △   T X   T □
D O         D O
D □   H X   H △
```

- Meteor Dodge Macro

Spam this to perform the cursed four hour meteor dodge. 

```text copy showLineNumbers
/mlock
/merror off
/automove on <wait.1>
/automove off
/echo
/echo
/echo
/echo
/echo
/echo
/echo
/echo
/echo
/echo
/echo
```

- P5 Limit Break Macro

You can use this macro to limit break without facing your target; as a phys range with proper positioning, this will allow you to limit break four meteors instead of three.

```text copy showLineNumbers
/mlock
/macroicon "Limit Break"
/autofacetarget off
/ac "Limit Break"
/autofacetarget on
```
- [6-1-1 Mit Plan Macros](https://pastebin.com/2dHaS4dh)

**Transition, every Akh Morn, and every Gigaflare require Kerachole/Sacred Soil.** The correct timing for an Akh Morn kera/SS is immediately after the second trinity in exaflares; this will ensure it catches all of akh morn and will be up for the subsequent giggleflare.
