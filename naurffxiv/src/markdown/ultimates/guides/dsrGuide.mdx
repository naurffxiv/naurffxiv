## Phase 1: Vault Knights
Phase 1 consists of three bosses: Adelphel, Grinnaux, and Charibert.
This section of the guide will be following the [P1 Toolbox](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=802461081524561&preview=1#1)
which is also listed in the DSR resource page.
Adelphel and Grinnaux will be the only bosses targeteable at the start of this phase.

Before pulling, discuss who is tanking which boss. It doesn't matter who tanks which boss. 
It also needs to be discussed who will be taking which tank busters that will be explained. 
Tanks are also free to use mitigation throughout this phase as they see fit. 
The autos don’t do a crazy amount of damage but Grin does do more damage than Adel. 
Your healers will love you if they are mitigated.

When ready to begin the pull, the tanks should pull the bosses to the center of the room.
The party should focus their DPS on Adelphel as he will jump away the party after a couple short mechanics.
The begining of hase will start off with Holiest of Holy, a raidwide AoE.
After the raidwide, Adelphel will spawn a tank buster tether on a random person. 
This tether consists of two tank busters: Holy Shield Bash and Holy Bladedance

One of the tanks will take this Tether north away from the party and invuln the damage. 
The rest of the party stacks south of both bosses tight on the hitbox.
The party will need to avoid the tether, a Donut AoE: Empty Dimension, and share an AoE: Heavensblaze.
### Hyperdimensional Slashes
A few moments after the tank buster, Adelphel will jump to the side of the arena.
Grinnaux will then dash to the middle beginning the next mechanic: Hyperdimensional Slashes.

At the start of this mechanic, four random players will be marked with orange markers.
These markers siginfy players that are being targeting for a line AoE that will also drop a cloud towards the end of line.
The clouds that are placed will explode if they are too close to one another or if a player gets too close.
The four players who are targeted will need to spread on the North Markers to bait these line AoEs.
If using the markers from the DSR resource page, they are placed in preceisely so you can stand in the middle of them.
They are spread enough to be safe from the other party members' AoEs and clouds.
There is no priority as you can spread out and even preposition to a marker before the mechanic. 

While the marked party members and are moving to their spread positions, 
the four non-marked party members will need to stack south on the tip of the diamond to bait a conal, shared AoE. 
One person who is not marked is randomly chosen to be the target of the shared AoE.

The line AoEs and shared AoE will both go off at the same time. 
After both the line and shared AoEs go off, the party will need to repeat the same mechanics as before but with the roles swapped.
The four players who were marked will now need to deal with the shared AoE the south group took.
The four players who were not marked will now need to spread for the line AoEs.
The four players who were not marked, will then be marked for line AoEs. 

*Note: To make the south spreads a bit easier, you can slightly preposition to the marker you want to go to.*
### Adelphel Dashes and Knockback
After the second set of Hyperdimensional Slashes, Adelphel will jump to a random cardinal direction starting the next mechanic.

The party should position opposite of Adelphel and prepare for a knockback from Grinnaux: Faith Unmoving. 
Players may use KB prevention or ride the knockback. Just be careful to not be knocked into the wall or the clouds that were dropped. 
Grinnaux will also cast another Holiest of Holy raid wide as the knock back goes off.

After the knockback, Adelphel will dash to around the arena in an hour glass formation dropping exploding orbs in his path.
The first dash will always be to a cardinal left or right of him. 
To avoid the exploding orbs and his dashes, the party will need to move in the direction where he initially dashes to.
While moving in that direction, the party should be moving to the triangle shaped marking on the floor. 
Be sure not to be too far out or too far in. 
You can still trigger a cloud explosion or get hit by the dash and orbs from Adelphel.

Once Adelphel finishes his dashes, he will follow up with a tankbuster on whoever has aggro of him. 
This tank buster knocks anyone back into the wall of death who is near the tank taking the tank buster. 
The tank with Adelphel will move away from the group as the last dashes go off to not send anyone into the wall.

When the dashes and tank buster have resolved, Adelphel will attempt to cast Holiest Hallowing.
This cast must be interrupted or the bosses will be healed making the phase unclearable.
This will be cast a total of three times in this phase. The order for interrupts should be Tank > Phys Ranged > Tank.
### Faith Unmoving
Take both bosses to the center of the room and prepare for the next mechanic: Faith Unmoving.
Tanks will need to make sure that the bosses are centered as much as possible, especially Grinnaux.
As the mechanic starts, each player will be marked with a Playstation marker above their head and chained to a partner with the same marker.

* Tanks will receive a Cross or Square. 
* Healers will receive a Cross or Triangle. 
* DPS receive a circle, Square, or Triangle.

These chains need to be snapped or you will most likely be one shot.
Tanks can survive but receive damage down.
The chains will snap once far enough apart causing damage to each person on the tether.
In addition to the chains and markers, Charibert who is outside the arena will cast an AoE on each player forcing the group to spread.
Lastly, Faith Unmoving is a knockback cast that will help break chains and position all party members for the spread AoEs.

To resolve the mechanic, we must first position ourselves for knockback so that we can break our chains. 
As stated above, only certain roles will get certain markers which makes it relatively static to solve this mechanic. 
The players with the markers will position themselves as followed depending on their role:

Crosses position North and South
* Tank Cross - North
* Healer Cross - South

Triangles position North West and South East
* DPS Triangle - North West
* Healer Triangle - South East

Circles position East and West.
* DPS Circles will need to determine who is going East or West.
* Since only DPS get circles, they will need to communicate with body language or prepositioning who is going where.

Squares position North East and South West
* Tank Square - North East
* DPS Square - South West

These positions ensure it so your partner will always be across from you during the knockback to break the chain. 
Once Grinnaux finishes the Faith Unmoving cast, everyone should be knocked back toward the edge of the arena, breaking the chains.
Warriors should note that Inner Release knockback prevention will prevent them from being knocked back if the buff active.
Shortly after the knock back, the spread AoE will go off on each player.
Make sure to be close the wall to avoid overlapping as the AoEs are quite large.
### AoEs and Interrupts
Once the spread AoEs go off, tanks should bring the bosses back to the center of the room.
The party will need to group up for heals and keep the bosses around the same HP.
Another Holiest Hallowing will be cast which needs to be interrupted by the Phys Ranged. 

Shortly after that cast, another Holiest of Holy raidwide will be cast along with either a Full/Empty Dimension. 
This is the same mechanic at the start of the phase but it can either be a donut or pointblank AoE. Full is out, Empty is in. 

After the raid wide, yet another Holiest Hallowing will be cast which needs to be interrupted by the Tank.
Another Holiest of Holy will be cast followed by The Bell’s Steel caste. 
This is an enrage cast that heals both bosses and wipes the party. 
Both bosses need to be defeated at the same time or the one who did not die with the other will cast a quick enrage.
### Imprisonment
Once both bosses are defeated, they jump to the west side of the arena along with Charibert to pull you into the center of a death wall.
While in this imprisonment, all players will be chained to Grinnaux and movement speed will be reduced.
Haurchefaunt will also spawn outside the arena to block an incoming attack which will cause raidwide damage until he is killed.

Throughout this mechanic, Charibert will be casting Pure of Heart which is the enrage cast.
To beat this enrage, you have to get him below 30% before the cast is finished.

Throughout the mechanic, four sets of two cone AoEs will need to be taken one after another which originate from Charibert.
These cones are baited and hit the 2 closest players to him.
Once a player is hit, they are applied with a skyblind debuff that will drop a puddle under you once expired.
To resolve this mechanic, 2 sets of players need to bait the cones south away from the party who stack north of Charibert. 

The order for the players taking the baits is: Healers > Melee > Ranged > Tanks

After a cone is baited, move to one side of the party to drop the puddle debuff.
Healers and Ranged will drop their puddle East of the party.
Melee and Tanks will drop their puddles to the West of the party.
Tanks can alternatively drop the puddles where they took the bait as they are the last ones.

Once all baits have been taken, the cast will finish resulting in a raidwide AoE.
If the boss reaches below 30%, you will continue on to the next phase.
If not, the raid wide will kill you, sending you back to the start of the phase.
