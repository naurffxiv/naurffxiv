# Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate) In-Depth Guide

Welcome to NAUR's in-depth guide for Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate).

This guide will cover each phase in detail and provide tips to help you clear and understand the fight.
All of the strategies featured in this guide follow NA PF Strats.
These strats are commonly referred to as APD or NAUR strats.

If you have any questions regarding this guide, please feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/naurffxiv) and ask them.
Any issues or concerns can also be reported on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/naurffxiv/naurffxiv).

## Pre-Fight Notes

Before reading the guide, there are a couple things to note about the fight:

1. To unlock DSR, you will need to have cleared "**Asphodelos: The Fourth Circle (Savage)**" and then speak to the Wandering Minstrel in Old Sharlayan.

2. When entering the instance, all players should try to be equipped with Best in Slot (BiS) gear as well as the highest tier of food and tinctures available.
   BiS gear is not entirely required to clear the fight but it will make the fight easier and more manageable with mistakes.
   Feel free to refer to the
   [NAUR - Current FFXIV Ultimate BiS Sets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V5HIN_yUxc-PIQQDv8zKkQ9TQNZ3OxQc66AxKIC_KaQ/edit?gid=1170720130#gid=1170720130)
   spreadsheet for some example sets.

3. To better utilize this guide, please refer to the resources found in the [DSR resource page](/ultimates/dsr).
   Many resources such as raidplans, mitigation plans, cheat sheets, and more can be found there.

4. It should also be noted that if a player fails a mechanic in this fight, they will often receive a "**Damage Down**".
   The "**Damage Down**" debuff in DSR will reduce the damage dealt by the player by 50% for 3 minutes.
   In most cases, it is recommended for players to die when they receive this debuff as the "**Weakness**" debuff is shorter and reduces less damage.
   This is not always the case as some mechanics will require you to stay alive to resolve them but good to keep in mind.

## P1: Adelphel, Grinnaux and Charibert

Phase 1 features "**Ser Adelphel**" (Paladin), "**Ser Grinnaux**" (Warrior), and "**Ser Charibert**" (Black Mage).
Only "**Ser Adelphel**" and "**Ser Grinnaux**" are initially targetable.
This guide follows the [P1 Toolbox](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=802461081524561&preview=1#1) from the DSR resource page.

Notes before pulling:

1. Decide tank assignments. Each tank typically handles their assigned boss's tank busters.
2. Plan tank mitigation for the bosses' auto attacks. Note that Grinnaux's autos hit harder than Adelphel's.
3. Be sure to interrupt Adelphel's "**Holiest Hallowing**" cast (occurs three times).
   This cast must be interrupted or the bosses will be healed, making the phase impossible.

Order of interrupts is: Adelphel Tank > Phys. Ranged > Adelphel Tank.

Pull both bosses center and focus DPS on Adelphel. The phase begins with "**Holiest of Holy**", a heavy-hitting raidwide.
Afterward, "**Ser Adelphel**" spawns a tether on a random player, consisting of two tank busters: "**Holy Shield Bash**" and "**Holy Bladedance**".

The tank who has aggro of him will take this tether north using invulnerability while the party stacks south to avoid cleave damage.
A few moments after the tether spawns, both "**Ser Grinnaux**" and "**Ser Charibert**" will cast mechanics of their own as the tether resolves.

"**Ser Grinnaux's**" cast is "**Empty Dimension**". This is a donut AoE that originates from him.
The party will need to make sure to be close to him.

"**Ser Charibert's**" cast is "**Heavensblaze**". This is a small AoE that will target a random party member.
The more players that stand in the AoE, the less damage it will do so the party should be stacked.

### Hyperdimensional Slashes

After the tank buster and AoEs, "**Ser Adelphel**" jumps to the arena's side becoming immune to damage while "**Ser Grinnaux**" dashes center for two sets of "**Hyperdimensional Slashes**".
Four random party members will be marked with orange markers above their player model while four others will remain unmarked.

The markers signify party members that are being targeted for a "**Hyperdimensional Slash**".
These slashes fire a line AoE in the direction of the marked party members.
The line AoE will also drop a "**Portal**" at the end of the line AoE.

_Note: If these "**Portals**" are too close to one another or if a party member gets too close to them, they will explode and
deal damage to the party. This will also apply a "**Damage Down**" debuff to the players hit by the explosion._

The four marked party members will need to spread in a way to avoid clipping other party members and place the "**Portals**" far enough away from each other.
To avoid clipping the unmarked players, the first set of slashes will be taken on the north side of the arena.
If the party is using the markers from the DSR resource page, they are placed precisely so you can stand in the middle of them to avoid the other marked players.

_Note: There is no priority for spread positions. Try to preposition to where you want to go to avoid confusion._

The party members who are not targeted for slashes will need to stack south on the tip of the middle diamond to bait a conal, shared AoE from "**Ser Grinnaux**".
One party member who is not marked is randomly chosen to be the target of the shared AoE.

Both the line AoEs and the shared AoE will go off at the same time.
As both initial mechanics resolve, the unmarked party members will now be marked and the marked players will no longer be marked.
The new marked players will need to spread on the south side of the arena just as the other players did on the north side while the north side stacks to share the conal AoE.

_Note: To make the south spreads a bit easier, you can slightly preposition to the marker you want to go to when sharing the previous stack._

### Ser Adelphel Dashes

After the second set of "**Hyperdimensional Slashes**", "**Ser Adelphel**" will jump to a random cardinal direction starting the next mechanic.

The party should position opposite of "**Ser Adelphel**" and prepare for a knockback from "**Ser Grinnaux**": **Faith Unmoving**.
The party should use KB prevention to avoid being knocked into the wall or the **"Portals"**.
"**Ser Grinnaux**" will also cast another "**Holiest of Holy**" raidwide as the knockback goes off.

After the knockback, "**Ser Adelphel**" will dash around the arena in an hourglass formation dropping "**Bright Flare**" orbs as he dashes.
These orbs will explode after a short time.
The first dash will always be to a cardinal direction left or right of him.

To avoid the exploding orbs and his dashes, the party will need to move in the direction where he initially dashes to.
While moving in that direction, the party should be aiming for the green, triangle-shaped marking on the floor at one of the intercardinal directions.

Be sure not to be too far out or too far in while moving.
The "**Portals**" can still explode if someone is too close, or you can get hit by the dash and orbs from "**Ser Adelphel**".

Once "**Ser Adelphel**" finishes his dashes, he will follow up with a tank buster on whoever has aggro of him.
This tank buster knocks anyone back into the wall of death who is near the tank taking the tank buster.
The tank with "**Ser Adelphel**" should move away from the party as the last dashes go off to avoid sending anyone into the wall.

When the dashes and tank buster have resolved, "**Ser Adelphel**" will attempt to cast "**Holiest Hallowing**" that should be interrupted by the tank with aggro.
The other tank can interrupt if the tank with aggro is unable to.

### PlayStation Markers and Chains

Take both bosses to the center of the room and prepare for the next mechanic.
Tanks will need to make sure that the bosses are centered as much as possible, especially "**Ser Grinnaux**".

Every party member will be marked with a PlayStation marker above their head and be chained to a party member with the same marker.

- **Tanks**: Can receive Blue "X" or Purple Square.
- **Healers**: Can receive a Blue "X" or Green Triangle.
- **DPS**: Can receive a Red Circle, Purple Square, or Green Triangle.

The chains need to be broken before they expire or they will one-shot the players. Tanks can survive but receive damage down.

Before chains and markers are applied, the party should try to be as close to the center of the arena as possible.
The closer the party is to their partner when the chain is applied, the easier it will be to break the chain.

A couple moments after the markers are applied, "**Ser Grinnaux**" will cast another "**Faith Unmoving**" knockback.
Shortly after the knockback, "**Ser Charibert**" will cast an AoE on each party member.

To resolve the mechanic, a couple steps must be followed:

1. Move to the middle of the arena and prepare to be chained and marked.

2. Move to assigned position once marked and prepare for knockback.

As stated above, only certain roles will get certain markers.
Each marker has a predetermined position that is role dependent:

Blue "X" Positions

- Tank - North
- Healer - South

Green Triangle Positions

- DPS - North West
- Healer - South East

Purple Square Positions

- Tank - North East
- DPS - South West

Red Circle Positions

- Red Circle DPS Furthest West - West
- Red Circle DPS Furthest East - East

These positions ensure that your partner will always be across from you during the knockback to break the chain.

3. Prepare for the knockback from "**Ser Grinnaux**".

If positioned correctly, the knockback will send you to the edge of the arena, breaking the chain.
Make sure to not be far out and inline with "**Ser Grinnaux**".
If not properly positioned with him, you may get knocked back towards another player.
It is common for tanks to not have him properly positioned so adjust as needed.

_Warriors should note that Inner Release knockback prevention will prevent them from being knocked back if the buff is active._

4. Adjust position to avoid the AoE from "**Ser Charibert**" and prepare for the next mechanic.

As players are knocked back, the spread AoE will go off on each party member.
If positioned correctly, the players should be in position to take their AoE.
Make sure to be close to the wall and adjust away from players to avoid overlapping.

Tanks should bring the bosses back to the center of the room after resolving the PlayStation Markers, chains, and spreads.

The party will need to group up for heals and keep the bosses around the same HP.
Another "**Holiest Hallowing**" will be cast which needs to be interrupted by the Phys. Ranged.

_Note: If the Phys. Ranged is unable to interrupt, the "**Ser Grinnaux**" tank can interrupt if they have not already._

After the interrupt, "**Ser Adelphel**" will cast another "**Holiest of Holy**" raidwide while
"**Ser Grinnaux**" will cast a "**Full Dimension**" or "**Empty Dimension**" AoE.
This is the same mechanic at the start of the phase but it can either be a donut or point-blank AoE. Full is out, Empty is in.
After the raidwide, yet another "**Holiest Hallowing**" will be cast which needs to be interrupted by the Tank.
A final "**Holiest of Holy**" will be cast after the interrupt.

Finally, the "**The Bull's Steel**" will be cast.
This is an enrage cast that gives them invulnerability, damage buffs, and fully heals them, making the phase impossible to clear.
Both bosses need to be defeated at the same time or the one who did not die with the other will cast a quick enrage.

### Planar Prison

Once both bosses are defeated, they jump to the west side of the arena along with "**Ser Charibert**" to pull you into the center of a death wall.
While in this "**Planar Prison**", all party members will be chained to "**Ser Grinnaux**" and movement speed will be reduced.

"**Haurchefant**" will spawn outside the arena, blocking an incoming attack that will cause raid-wide damage until he is killed.
"**Haurchefant**" will also have a healing debuff called "HP Recovery Down", preventing him from being healed.

Throughout this mechanic, "**Ser Charibert**" will be casting "**Pure of Heart**", which is the enrage cast.
To beat this enrage, you must get him below 30% before the cast is finished.

During this time, four sets of two conal AoEs will be triggered in succession, emanating from "**Ser Charibert**".
These cones are baited and hit the two closest party members to him.
Once a party member is hit, they will be applied with a "Light Resistance Down" debuff and "**Skyblind**",
a puddle debuff that will drop a puddle under them once "**Skyblind**" expires.

To resolve this mechanic, two sets of party members need to bait the cones south, away from the party, who should stack north of "**Ser Charibert**".
The bait order is: Healers > Melee > Ranged > Tanks

After a cone is baited, move to one side of the party to drop the puddle debuff.
Healers and Ranged will drop their puddles left of "**Ser Charibert**", facing him.
Melee and Tanks will drop their puddles right of "**Ser Charibert**", facing him.
Tanks can alternatively drop the puddles where they took the bait as they are the last ones.

Once all baits have been taken, the cast will finish, resulting in a raid-wide AoE.
If "**Ser Charibert**" reaches below 30%, you will continue on to the next phase.
If not, the raid-wide will kill you, sending you back to the start of the phase.

The arena will transition to Phase 2 and "**King Thordan**" will spawn.
Make sure to tag and hit him. Not doing so will send you back to Phase 1.

## P2: King Thordan

The start of Phase 2 acts as a "checkpoint" for any future wipes.
Any wipe from now on will send you to the start of Phase 2 rather than Phase 1.
Markers should also be replaced with the second set of markers found in the [DSR resource page](/ultimates/dsr).

For the remainder of the fight, light parties will be used for positioning.
NA Party Finder usually uses a marker dance for specific mechanics, but generally, positions are light party based.

Tanks should refer to the [NAUR Mitigation Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YJX933Fe6MeNv06QVQfRUI3oJVfCvm4OqOyLCSjcAJk/edit?usp=sharing).
Tank cooldowns are extremely important in this fight and need to be followed.
All personal tank mitigation in this sheet is standard for NA PF strats.

The start of Phase 2 follows the [Start + Strength of the Ward Raidplan](https://raidplan.io/plan/NDX-6bF2djrDMB-v).

### Start of Phase 2

At the start of Phase 2, "**King Thordan**" begins with 3 heavy-hitting auto attacks that cleave the targeted tank.
Note that throughout the fight, "**King Thordan's**" auto attacks always cleave.

After his auto attacks, "**King Thordan**" casts "**Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**" - a baited protean AoE that will kill anyone hit by it.
Everyone except the MT should stack south of the boss to bait all proteans in the same direction.
Once the cast finishes, the party and main tank dodge to the side to avoid the proteans before returning to original positions.

"**King Thordan**" follows with a tank buster, "**Ascalon's Might**".
This hits 3 times and cleaves. Refer to the tank mitigation sheet for handling this tank buster.
After the TB, "**King Thordan**" begins casting "**Strength of the Ward**", the first major mechanic of Phase 2.

### Strength of the Ward

"**Strength of the Ward**" has multiple moving parts which is broken down into parts for easier understanding.

#### Strength of the Ward: Part 1

Once Thordan finishes casting, he jumps and becomes untargetable.
The first part involves four simultaneous mechanics:

- Three Knights spawn at random cardinals/intercardinals and cast "**Spiral Thrust**".
  They then dash across the arena, knocking anyone in their path into the wall of death.
- "**King Thordan**" targets everyone with "**Lightning Storm**" - a small AoE that kills players if overlapped.
- "**Ser Guerrique**" (Warrior) spawns at a random position in the center and casts "**Heavy Impact**" -
  an AoE that creates expanding rings.
- "**King Thordan**" prepares another "**Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**" as the party dodges the rings.

First, identify the safe spots from the knights’ dashes. There are always 2 "pizza slices" that are safe and opposite each other.
These are determined by the floor markers' color and will always be the same color if using standard markers.

Since one pizza slice can't fit everyone, the party must split into light parties:

- "**Light Party One**" goes to the side with number markers.
- "**Light Party Two**" goes to the side with letter markers.

Within these safe spots, spread to avoid "**Lightning Storm**" overlap:

- **Healers**: Align on the tri-force icon arena marking.
- **Tanks**: Position in front of healers using the blue line as a guide.
- **DPS**: Position 5 notches away from the healer.
  Melee to the healer's left (facing in); Ranged/Caster to the healer's right (facing in).

After "**Lightning Storm**" resolves, the knights' "**Spiral Thrust**" and "**Ser Guerrique's**" "**Heavy Impact**" rings activate.
For dodging the rings, see [Borunks' YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2bhPufIKM8) for visual guidance.
It's quite hard to explain in text, but the goal is to avoid the expanding rings while staying in the safe spots.
Step into the ring only once, staying in line with your group.

As you move in, note that two "**Paladins**" will spawn in the arena, serving as guides for the next part of "**Strength of the Ward**".
Keep note of what direction they are facing as they will be facing "**King Thordan**" for the next part of the mechanic.

"**King Thordan**" will appear in the center of the arena and still untargetable.
He will cast another "**Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**" targeting everyone with protean AoEs.
Move as a line without fanning out to avoid clipping others. Step left or right when the cast finishes to dodge.

#### Strength of the Ward: Part 2

After "**Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**" resolves, "**King Thordan**" will jump to a random cardinal or intercardinal position outside the arena.
He will appear where the two "**Paladins**" are facing and should be considered "**True North**" for this part of the mechanic.

Multiple mechanics occur simultaneously:

- Three players will be marked with blue circles above their heads for "**Skyward Leap**" (large defamation AoEs).
- One non-tank who is not targeted for "**Skyward Leap**" will be selected for a party stack, "**The Dragon's Rage**".
- Two tank tethers will spawn from the "**Paladins**" (same as P1's "**Holy Shield Bash/Holy Bladedance**" combo).
- Dark AoE puddles will appear, forcing players to the arena edges to resolve mechanics.
- Six towers will spawn that need to be soaked after "**Skyward Leap**" and "**The Dragon's Rage**".

Tanks should position under their designated "**Paladin**" to grab the tether. Facing "**King Thordan**",
Main Tank takes the right tether, Off Tank takes the left.
These tethers deal less damage when stretched farther, so cross them and bring them toward "**King Thordan**".
Tanks should end up to Thordan's left and right, facing the tethers outward away from the group.

"**Skyward Leap**" marked players must immediately move to designated safe spots at the new south,
east, and west sides of the arena (treating "**King Thordan**" as "**True North**").

There's no priority for these spots - go to the closest one while being aware of other marked players.
Move directly away from "**King Thordan**" and between the "**Paladins**" to avoid grabbing tank tethers.
Do not move into the tanks path to "**King Thordan**".

Position precisely to avoid hitting others:

- South marker: Stand at the edge of the wall in line with the tri-force.
- East and west markers: Stand 2-3 notches away from the tanks to avoid clipping them.

Non-tanks without "**Skyward Leap**" markers stack near "**King Thordan**" at the wall to share "**The Dragon's Rage**".
They must also call out which tower they'll take. Do this by slightly positioning where it will spawn before the stack resolves.

After all these mechanics resolve, six towers will spawn. Tanks will be down and unable to soak towers.
"**Skyward Leap**" players take towers slightly in front of them, while "**The Dragon's Rage**" stack members take the towers they positioned for earlier.

Once towers are soaked, "**King Thordan**" casts "**Ancient Quaga**", a heavy-hitting raidwide that ends Strength of the Ward.

Before the next major mechanic, "**King Thordan**" performs two tank busters:
First, "**Heavenly Heel**", a heavy-hitting tankbuster that inflicts the main tank with "**Slashing Resistance Down**". This is immediately followed up by "**Ascalon's Might**", which will kill the tank unless swapped or an invulnerability skill is used.
Refer to the tank mitigation sheet for handling these busters.

### Sanctity of the Ward

"**Sanctity of the Ward**" also has multiple parts which we'll break down for clarity.
The first part follows the [Sanctity of the Ward pt. 1 - Drk Relative Dodges Raidplan](https://raidplan.io/plan/2CYKJu6IHzBdolZu).

#### Sanctity of the Ward: Part 1

For this section, light parties and role-based partners from the opposite light party will be needed:

Partners: Tank-Tank | Healer-Healer | Melee-Melee | Phys. Ranged-Caster

Key mechanics occurring simultaneously:

1. "**Paladins**" spawn east and west, with a "**Dark Knight**" at a random intercardinal.
2. Two players receive markers: "one sword" or "two swords crossed", indicating who the "**Dark Knight**" will target with "**Sacred Sever**"
   ._(Shared proximity damage that hits a total of four time, with each marked players being hit twice for total of 4 hits. The further you are from the source, the less damage you will take)._
3. The "**Paladins**" dash around the arena dropping explosive "**Brightorbs**".
4. "**King Thordan**" and "**The Eye**" cast gaze mechanics from outside the arena that inflict "**Damage Down**" and "**Hysteria**" on players if looked at, with the latter causing complete loss of control.

First, check for sword markers above players' heads:

- Marker 1 (one sword): Go to the side **FURTHEST** from the "**Dark Knight**" (plunged first)
- Marker 2 (crossed swords): Go to the side **CLOSEST** to the "**Dark Knight**" (plunged second)

If unmarked, check if your partner has a marker. Change groups only if you get an opposite number from your initial light party or your partner receives your group's number.

Group positioning:

- Group 1: Position **AWAY** from Dark Knight, across the arena at the wall
- Group 2: Position **TOWARDS/BEHIND** the Dark Knight at the wall

When moving to positions, note which way the "**Paladins**" are facing (clockwise or counterclockwise). This determines your rotation direction for dodges.

As mechanics begin, dodge the "**Paladins**" dashes by moving four notches in your rotation direction to the first safe spot. Stay stacked for "**Sacred Sever**" damage sharing.

After the "**Brightorb**" in front of your party explodes, move into that space and continue 4-5 notches in the same direction (ending about 3 notches from the next tri-force). Remain stacked as the "**Dark Knight**" completes its plunges.

When the plunges and dashes finish, prepare for the second part of the mechanic.

#### Sanctity of the Ward: Part 2

The second part of "**Sanctity of the Ward**" follows the [Sanctity of the Ward pt. 2 - Meteors Raidplan](https://raidplan.io/plan/Src8CpFxCAUUuZEM).

For this part, split into pairs at each cardinal:

- Tank and Ranged: North and South (Group 1 North, Group 2 South)
- Healers and Melee: East and West (Group 1 West, Group 2 East)

Two players of the same role (Support or DPS) will get marked with "**Prey**".
These players will periodically drop 7 "**Meteors**" that cause minor raidwide damage.
The players handling the meteors will begin moving around the edge of the arena in opposite directions, ensuring they don't use Sprint or overlap the meteors, as doing so will cause them to explode, wiping the raid.

"**Prey**" players will always occupy the North and South starting positions.
If marked, move clockwise to North or South unless already in a North or South position.
If someone occupies your rotation spot, continue clockwise to either North or South.

To maintain pairs for the upcoming ice mechanic, same-role players will flex to spots left open by meteor players when applicable.
The "unmarked" role should plant in their default cardinals just outside the markers.

Ice puddles spawn on pairs and fire puddles on intercardinals, remaining until the mechanic ends.
Standing in these puddles causes a deadly bleed.
These ice puddles need to be shared or a player that takes the puddle solo will die.

Eight towers will spawn in the arena. Five or six out around the edge and three or two in the middle intercardinals.
Each tower needs one player to absorb it, with 2 towers per cardinal quadrant.
Patterns vary, but each quadrant will always have either 2 wall towers or 1 wall and 1 middle tower.

Each cardinal pair will be responsible for their quadrant's towers, with the exception of the middle intercardinal towers.
Cardinal pairs should prepare for tower soaking with these rules:

- Meteor role takes priority on outer wall towers and will always go out.
- If 2 wall towers are in your quadrant, both partners take the outside towers. Meteor role has priority on cardinal towers.
  If there is no cardinal tower, the meteor role takes the most clockwise tower.
- For inner towers, only one or no players from a pair go in; inner players take the closest tower clockwise.
  If no tower is initially clockwise, continue clockwise until finding an empty tower.

North/South pairs follow additional guidelines:

- Meteor players should position 180 degrees apart when possible to avoid problematic meteor patterns
- Use pre-positioning to signal which tower you'll take
- Both N/S pairs should prepare for meteors to create a straight-across pattern

After tower absorption, marked players begin dropping meteors while rotating approximately 180 degrees around the arena in a clockwise pattern.
Take a long path (staggering, zigzagging, etc.) to practice for difficult patterns.

During meteor drops, another set of 8 towers spawns along the wall at cardinals and intercardinals.
Meteor roles take cardinal towers; non-meteor roles take intercardinal towers.

"**Ser Grinnaux**" will appear and begin casting "**Faith Unmoving**", which triggers a knockback.

- Outside players: **must** use knockback immunity to avoid being sent into the death wall.
- Inside players: can ride the knockback into their tower's position.
  Activate knockback immunity when "**Ser Hermenost's**" Conviction cast reaches the "C" in the castbar, or after the 5th meteor drops.

Once all towers are soaked, **Sanctity** ends. **Thordan** will appear to the north and cast "**Ultimate End**", a heavy-hitting raidwide. After this, he receives the "**Discomposed**" debuff, increasing his damage taken by 30%.

He will then cast two sets of "**Broad Swings**", each consisting of three slashes. Each set can be random, but the pattern always starts with either **Left** or **Right** and finishes with **Back**.
To dodge these:

1. Start behind **Thordan**.
2. Move into the safe spot for the first swing, which can either be left or right.
3. Wait until Thordan repositions and then readjust for the next swing.

Finally, **Thordan** begins his enrage cast "**Aetheric Burst**" and must be killed before it completes.

## P3: Nidhogg

Once Thordan is defeated, the arena will transition into Phase 3, starting with a massive raid-wide AoE, _Final Chorus_, from Nidhogg as he descends into the arena. Once he appears, he will begin auto-attacking the main tank three times with cleaving line AoEs. The tank should face the boss north at the A marker. Once the auto-attacks finish, he will apply debuffs to random players, starting the _Wyrmhole_ mechanic.

Three _First in Line_ (I) debuffs, two _Second in Line_ (II) debuffs, and three _Third in Line_ (III) debuffs will be applied. These indicate when a Nidstinien clone will drop on you. After being dropped on, you will spawn a tower that _someone else_ in the party must soak. After they soak the tower, a Nidstinien clone will appear on it, and the soaker must point it away from the party.

Additionally, one or two groups of numbers will receive an up arrow or a down arrow debuff among them. These debuffs, along with the crosshair, indicate where you will spawn a tower after getting hit by your dive.

- An up arrow (_Spineshatter Dive_) means your tower will spawn _in front_ of you.
- A down arrow (_Elusive Jump_) means it will spawn _behind_ you.
- _Prey_ (_High Jump_) means your tower will spawn _directly on you_.

To make this mechanic as easy as possible, we will be doing _Westhogg_. This means that if you have an arrow, you will always be facing west, ensuring that you always drop a tower to your arrow buddy.

Throughout this mechanic, everyone will be hit by a dive and will need to soak a tower at different times. Before the mechanic starts, the group can do a few things to make it easier to determine who is taking which spot if a group of numbers does not receive an arrow. Before the arrows are assigned, the party can claim a spot in case their group does not have arrows.

- _1s and 3s_ should claim a spot by pre-positioning at the west, south, or east cardinals around the boss.
- _2s_ should claim a spot west/east in front of the boss.
- _Players with a DOWN arrow_ will always claim the _west_ spot of their number group.
- _Players with an UP arrow_ will always claim the _east_ spot of their number group.

An easy way to remember the order of who is placing and soaking a tower is:

- **First set:** 1s place towers, 3s soak towers.
- **Second set:** 2s place towers, east and west 1s soak towers.
- **Third set:** 3s place towers, 2s take east and west towers, and south 1 takes the south tower.

Once the debuffs have all been applied, Nidhogg will begin casting _Gnash and Lash_ or _Lash and Gnash_. This dictates the order of in/out AoEs during the coming mechanic dance.

- _Gnash_ = Out
- _Lash_ = In

He will cast this twice during the phase, and the pattern is _not guaranteed to be opposite_. The party stacks north on the boss, as they will be taking a stack when 1s get hit. 1s position themselves to place their towers at the edge of the boss's hitbox in the position they indicated during setup. _Gnash and Lash_ have a delayed execution—be aware!

When the cast bar completes, 1s will be hit, they will lose their debuffs, and they will receive a fire vulnerability, preventing them from soaking anything in the next set. 1s should face the proper direction to resolve their tower. The rest of the party stacks north to take _Eye of the Tyrant_ (heavy stack damage). 3s then move into position to soak towers where 1s placed them, following the setup or their assigned arrow.

Nidhogg clones will appear where towers were soaked. They will target the closest player (should be the soaker) and lock in their position after a very short time. Later, they will do a large line AoE in that direction. We want to bait these lines out towards the wall. However, you need to dodge the second part of _Gnash/Lash_ first. This is why you want towers placed as close to the hitbox as possible. Dodge the next part of _Gnash/Lash_ shortly after dodging the first.

**Bait the lines outwards.** It can be tough to bait the line perfectly outside if _Lash_ just occurred; in this case, baiting it anywhere east, west, or south is acceptable. _Never bait 1s and 3s north or through Nidstinien!_

As the 3s are baiting their line AoEs, 2s will place their towers at max melee northeast and northwest, following the setup or their assigned arrow. Make sure to face west if you have arrows! At this point, 3s should prepare to drop their towers.

Once the 2s' towers are dropped, the clones will shoot out their line AoEs, and the 2s' towers will appear. These two towers will be soaked by the 1s who were the east and west towers; east 1 soaks east 2, west 1 soaks west 2. Nidhogg will also begin casting _Gnash and Lash_ or _Lash and Gnash_ again.

The 1s who just baited the clones need to aim them outward at an angle to avoid clipping players who will be moving around the boss to soak the next set of towers. Once the clones are baited, the five players who already dropped a tower need to stack on A to take another stack, as Nidhogg will cast another _Gnash and Lash_/_Lash and Gnash_. The 2s don't have much time to get to the stack, so be ready to move once the clone is locked in.

Once the cast bar completes, the stack will go off, followed by the first part of _Gnash and Lash_, and the #3 towers will be placed. The west tower will be soaked by 2 west. The east tower will be soaked by 2 east. The south tower will be soaked by 1 south. Move to soak towers and be ready to dodge the next part of _Gnash and Lash_. Once you dodge the final part, 3s will soak their towers and bait the clones out to the wall.

Once the clones are baited, the main tank needs to move away from the party as they will begin to receive auto-attacks again. The tank can stand in front of where the clones were just baited or move away on an intercardinal. There will be two cleaving tank autos, and then Nidhogg will face a random player to cast _Drachenlance_, a lethal AoE—move out of the way.

Once _Drachenlance_ is cast, move with your previous meteor partner to the clockwise intercardinal from your meteor position to prepare for tower soaks. One tower spawns at each intercardinal. Each tower requires 1-4 players to soak. All eight players must be in a tower. If a tank/melee’s default tower only requires one person, they must adjust by looking clockwise, then counterclockwise, then diagonally for a tower that needs 3 or 4 soakers.

Three of these four towers will spawn Nidstinien clones, which will snap onto the nearest player, just like before. Ranged should stand in the center of the tower to ensure the clones face them. Point clones outward. One tower and the boss will tether to players. Tanks should follow the mitigation sheet.

Finally, cleaving autos resume, followed by one last _Drachenlance_ before enrage. If the boss is at 8% or lower before enrage, you should clear the phase and move on to P4.
