  compresses images according to the settings below
  input is based on current working directory,
  make sure you're at the base project directory
  
  run with `node scripts/compress-images.js` or `npm run compress`

  there are multiple modes to compress with, you can switch between them by adding a number arg
  e.g 
  `node scripts/compress-images.js 2`
  `npm run compress 2`

  (worse quality, intended to be compressed variants of images)
  1 - default, resize width to 1000px (maintaining aspect ratio), convert to avif with 75 quality
  2 - convert to avif with 50 quality

  (better quality, intended to "replace" original assets which are too large to serve in the imagemodal)
  3 - resize to 2560, keep as png 
  4 - resize to 2560, convert to jpeg with 75 quality
