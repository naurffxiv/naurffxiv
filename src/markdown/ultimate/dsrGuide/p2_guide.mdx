# [P2: King Thordan](<(https://raidplan.io/plan/NDX-6bF2djrDMB-v)>)

{/* todo: Images */}

The start of Phase 2 acts as a "checkpoint" for any future wipes. Any wipe from now on will send you
to the start of Phase 2 rather than Phase 1. Markers should also be replaced with the second set of
markers found in the [DSR resource page](/ultimate/dsr).

For the remainder of the fight, light parties will be used for positioning. Positions are always
light party based.

Tanks should refer to the [NAUR Mitigation Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YJX933Fe6MeNv06QVQfRUI3oJVfCvm4OqOyLCSjcAJk/edit?usp=sharing).
Tank cooldowns are extremely important in this fight and need to be followed.

## Start of Phase 2

At the start of Phase 2, **King Thordan** begins with 3 heavy-hitting auto attacks that cleave the
targeted tank.

> Note that throughout the fight, **King Thordan's** auto attacks always cleave.

After his auto attacks, **King Thordan** casts "**Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**" - a baited protean AoE
that will kill anyone hit by it. Everyone except the MT should stack south of the boss to bait all
proteans in the same direction. Once the cast finishes, the party and main tank dodge to the side to
avoid the proteans before returning to original positions.

**King Thordan** follows with a tank buster, "**Ascalon's Might**". This hits 3 times and cleaves.
After the TB, **King Thordan** begins casting "**Strength of the Ward**", the first major mechanic
of Phase 2.

## Strength of the Ward

{/* todo: Images */}
"**Strength of the Ward**" has multiple moving parts which is broken down into parts for easier
understanding.

### Strength of the Ward: Part 1

Once Thordan finishes casting, he jumps and becomes untargetable.
The first part involves four simultaneous mechanics:

- Three Knights spawn at random cardinals/intercardinals and cast "**Spiral Thrust**". They then dash
  across the arena, knocking anyone in their path into the wall of death.
- **King Thordan** targets everyone with "**Lightning Storm**" - a small AoE that kills players if
  overlapped.
- **Ser Guerrique** (Warrior) spawns at a random position in the center and casts "**Heavy Impact**" -
  an AoE that creates expanding rings.
- **King Thordan** prepares another "**Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**" as the party dodges the rings.

First, identify the safe spots from the knights' dashes. There are always 2 "pizza slices" that are
safe and opposite each other. These are determined by the floor markers' color and will always be the
same color if using standard markers.

Since one pizza slice can't fit everyone, the party must split into light parties:

- "**Light Party One**" goes to the side with number markers.
- "**Light Party Two**" goes to the side with letter markers.

Within these safe spots, spread to avoid "**Lightning Storm**" overlap:

- **Healers**: Align on the tri-force icon on the wall.
- **Tanks**: Position in front of healers using the blue line as a guide.
- **DPS**: Position 5 notches away from the healer. Melee to the healer's left (facing in);
  Ranged/Caster to the healer's right (facing in).

After "**Lightning Storm**" resolves, the knights' "**Spiral Thrust**" and **Ser Guerrique's**
"**Heavy Impact**" rings activate. For dodging the rings, see Borunks' YouTube video for visual guidance.
It's quite hard to explain in text, but the goal is to avoid the expanding rings while staying in the
safe spots. Step into the ring only once, staying in line with your group.

As you move in, note that two **Paladins** will spawn in the arena. Keep note of which direction they
are facing as the side furthest from them is where **King Thordan** will appear for the next part of
the mechanic.

**King Thordan** will appear in the center of the arena and still untargetable. He will cast another
"**Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**" targeting everyone with protean AoEs. Move as a line without fanning
out to avoid clipping others. Step left or right when the cast finishes to dodge.

### Strength of the Ward: Part 2

{/* todo: Image */}
After "**Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**" resolves, **King Thordan** will jump to a random cardinal or
intercardinal position outside the arena. He will appear on the side furthest from where the two
**Paladins** are facing. **Thordan's** position should be considered "**Relative North**" for this
part of the mechanic.

Multiple mechanics occur simultaneously:

- Three players will be marked with blue circles above their heads for "**Skyward Leap**" (large
  defamation AoEs).
- One non-tank who is not targeted for "**Skyward Leap**" will be selected for a party stack,
  "**The Dragon's Rage**".
- Two tank tethers will spawn from the **Paladins** (same as P1's "**Holy Shield Bash/Holy Bladedance**"
  combo).
- Dark AoE puddles will appear, forcing players to the arena edges to resolve mechanics.
- Six towers will spawn that need to be soaked after "**Skyward Leap**" and "**The Dragon's Rage**".

Tanks should grab their designated tether. Facing **King Thordan**, Main Tank takes the right tether,
Off Tank takes the left. These tethers deal less damage when stretched farther, so cross them and
bring them toward **King Thordan**. Tanks should end up to Thordan's left and right, facing the
tethers outward away from the group.

"**Skyward Leap**" marked players must immediately move to designated safe spots at the new south,
east, and west sides of the arena (treating **King Thordan** as **Relative North**).

There's no priority for these spots - go to the closest one while being aware of other marked players.
To avoid grabbing tank tethers, take the long route around the **Paladins** rather than cutting
between them. Do not move into the tanks' path to **King Thordan**.

Position precisely to avoid hitting others:

- South marker: Stand at the edge of the wall in line with the tri-force.
- East and west markers: Stand 2-3 notches away from **Relative North** (where Thordan is).

Non-tanks without "**Skyward Leap**" markers stack near **King Thordan** at the wall to share
"**The Dragon's Rage**". They should also preposition on the wall (left/right/middle) to indicate
which tower they'll take.

After all these mechanics resolve, six towers will spawn. Tanks will be down and unable to soak towers.
All non-tanks will take their assigned/claimed tower.

Once towers are soaked, **King Thordan** casts "**Ancient Quaga**", a heavy-hitting raidwide that ends
Strength of the Ward.
Before the next major mechanic, **King Thordan** performs two tank busters:
First, "**Heavenly Heel**", a heavy-hitting tankbuster that inflicts the main tank with
"**Slashing Resistance Down**". This is immediately followed up by "**Ascalon's Might**", which will
kill the tank unless swapped or an invulnerability skill is used.

After the tank busters, **King Thordan** will cast "**Sanctity of the Ward**", the next major mechanic.

## Sanctity of the Ward

{/* todo: Images */}

### Sanctity of the Ward: Part 1

For this section, light parties and role-based partners from the opposite light party will be needed:

Partners: Tank-Tank | Healer-Healer | Melee-Melee | Phys. Ranged-Caster

Key mechanics occurring simultaneously:

1. **Paladins** spawn east and west, with a **Dark Knight** at a random intercardinal.

2. Two players receive markers: "one sword" or "two swords crossed", indicating who the **Dark Knight**
   will target with "**Sacred Sever**". (Shared proximity damage that hits a total of four times, with
   each marked player being hit twice for a total of 4 hits. The further you are from the source, the
   less damage you will take).

3. The **Paladins** dash around the arena dropping explosive "**Brightorbs**".

4. **King Thordan** and "**The Eye**" cast gaze mechanics from outside the arena that inflict
   "**Damage Down**" and "**Hysteria**" on players if looked at. Hysteria causes your character to
   move uncontrollably in random directions. Looking at the eye also deals damage.

First, check for sword markers above players' heads:

- Marker 1 (one sword): Go to the wall directly across from the **Dark Knight** (plunged first)
- Marker 2 (crossed swords): Go to the wall directly behind the **Dark Knight** (plunged second)

If unmarked, check if your partner has a marker. Change groups only if you get an opposite number
from your initial light party or your partner receives your group's number.

Group positioning:

- Group 1: Position on the wall directly across from the **Dark Knight**
- Group 2: Position on the wall directly behind the **Dark Knight**

When prepositioning, note which way the **Paladins** are facing (clockwise or counterclockwise).
This determines your rotation direction for dodges. Preposition approximately 3-4 notches from the
fidget spinner on the wall. This initial positioning is crucial.

As mechanics begin, dodge the **Paladins** dashes by moving four notches in your rotation direction
to the first safe spot. Stay stacked for "**Sacred Sever**" damage sharing.

After the "**Brightorb**" in front of your party explodes, move into that space and continue 4-5
notches in the same direction (ending about 3 notches from the next tri-force). Remain stacked as
the **Dark Knight** completes its plunges.

When the plunges and dashes finish, prepare for the second part of the mechanic.

### [Sanctity of the Ward: Part 2](https://raidplan.io/plan/Src8CpFxCAUUuZEM)

{/* todo: Markdown feels empty */}

For this part, split into pairs at each cardinal:

- Tank and Ranged: North and South (Group 1 North, Group 2 South)
- Healers and Melee: East and West (Group 1 West, Group 2 East)

Two players of the same role (Support or DPS) will get marked with "**Prey**".
These players will periodically drop 7 "**Meteors**" that cause minor raidwide damage.

"**Prey**" players will always occupy the North and South starting positions.
If marked, move clockwise to North or South unless already in a North or South position.
If someone occupies your rotation spot, continue clockwise to either North or South.

Each cardinal position forms a Support+DPS pair. These stacks will drop ice puddles when the
mechanic resolves. The ice puddles need to be shared by the pair - a player taking an ice puddle
solo will die. Fire puddles will appear on intercardinals. Standing in either puddle type causes
a deadly bleed.

As the phase continues, each pair should use body language to indicate which tower they intend to
take. This is especially important for East/West pairs, as they have more flexibility in tower
assignments. Players typically walk in the direction of their intended tower to communicate this.

Eight towers will spawn in the arena. Each quadrant will always have at least one outer tower
(at the wall). Each tower needs one player to absorb it.

Cardinal pairs are responsible for the towers in their quadrant, with these rules:

- Meteor role takes priority on outer wall towers and will always go out.
- If 2 wall towers are in your quadrant, both partners take the outside towers. Meteor role has
  priority on cardinal towers. If there is no cardinal tower, the meteor role takes the most
  clockwise tower.
- For inner towers, only one or no players from a pair go in; inner players take the closest tower
  clockwise. If no tower is initially clockwise, continue clockwise until finding an empty tower.

North/South meteor players should aim to be 180 degrees apart when possible, following this priority:

1. North/South (ideal)
2. 180 degrees in some other configuration (e.g., NE/SW)
3. Slightly cursed (e.g., North + SW)
4. Cursed (same sub-direction, e.g., NE/SE)

This body language is particularly critical in the "double outer tower" pattern where there are 4
towers at NE/NW and SE/SW positions.

After tower absorption, marked players must **immediately** begin moving clockwise around the arena
to drop meteors. Any delay will cause the meteors to spawn too close together and explode. The path
taken depends on the pattern:

- 180-degree pattern: Simply move from N→S or S→N
- Slightly cursed pattern: The player with less than 180 degrees should take the longest possible
  route, moving around the fire/ice puddles
- Cursed pattern: Requires specialized movement techniques (refer to video examples)

During meteor drops, another set of 8 towers spawns along the wall at cardinals and intercardinals.
Meteor roles take cardinal towers; non-meteor roles take intercardinal towers.

**Ser Grinnaux** will appear and begin casting "**Faith Unmoving**", which triggers a knockback.

- Outside players: **must** activate knockback immunity when **Ser Hermenost's** Conviction cast
  reaches the "C" in the castbar, or after the 5th meteor drops.
- Inside players: can ride the knockback into their tower's position.

Once all towers are soaked, **Sanctity** ends. **Thordan** will appear to the north and cast
"**Ultimate End**", a heavy-hitting raidwide. After this, he receives the "**Discomposed**" debuff,
increasing his damage taken by 30%.

He will then cast two sets of "**Broad Swings**", each consisting of three slashes (similar to a
mini-trine or 3-1 dodge mechanic). Each set can be random, but the pattern always starts with either
**Left** or **Right** and finishes with **Back**. To dodge these:

1. Start behind **Thordan**.
2. Move into the safe spot for the first swing (the area he is not swinging at).
3. Wait until Thordan repositions and then readjust for the next swing.

Finally, **Thordan** begins his enrage cast "**Aetheric Burst**" and must be killed before it completes.
