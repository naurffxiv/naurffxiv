# Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate) Guide

## Overview

![Thordan](/images/thumbnails/ultimate/Thordan.png)

Welcome to NAUR's guide for **"Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)"**.
This guide covers each phase in detail with practical tips to help you understand and clear the fight.

All strategies in this guide follow North American Party Finder (NA PF) standard strats.
The suite of strats found here are commonly referred to as "**APD**" or "**NAUR**" strats.

To maximize the usefulness of this guide, please utilize the resources available on the [DSR resource page](/ultimate/dsr).
Each phase guide within this resource will highlight when specific tools or resources should be utilized.

## Preparation

### Unlocking Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)

To unlock DSR, you must:
- Have a Disciple of War or Magic level 90 job
- Clear "**Asphodelos: The Fourth Circle (Savage)**"
- Speak to the Wandering Minstrel in Old Sharlayan (X:12.7, Y:14.2)

### Gear and Consumables

All players should aim to have:
- Best in Slot (BiS) gear
- Highest tier food and tinctures available

BiS gear and consumables are not strictly required, but they will significantly improve your margin for error.
For example BiS gear sets, check the [NAUR - Current FFXIV Ultimate BiS Sets](https://tinyurl.com/naur-bis-sets) spreadsheet.

<Callout>
While the duty has an item level sync of 605, using equipment with an item level of at least 725 is able to maximize your sub-stats
(like Critical Hit, Direct Hit, and Determination) due to how item level sync calculations work.
Higher item level gear will provide better substat allocation even when synced down.

### Restrictions and Penalties

Unlike other types of High-end content, Ultimate Duties have unique restrictions and penalties that can be applied to players.

#### Restrictions

- **Party Composition**: Must consist of exactly 8 players
- **Job Restrictions**: Limited jobs (Blue Mage, etc.) cannot participate
- **Party Type**: Unrestricted parties are not permitted


#### Penalties

- **Duplicate Jobs**: Having multiple players on the same job will prevent passive limit break generation
- **Disconnection Policy**: Players who disconnect or log out during active combat will be automatically KO'd upon reconnection
- **Failing Mechanics**: Players who fail mechanics will be penalized with a <Buff b="damage-down" type="json" /> if they are not KO'd

<Callout type="tip"> 
In specific situations, intentionally accepting a KO can be more beneficial than continuing with <Buff b="damage-down" type="json" />.
<Buff b="weakness" type="json" /> often results in less DPS loss compared to the <Buff b="damage-down" type="json" /> penalty.
- Always prioritize mechanic completion first
- Only consider self-KO when you're certain you are not required to solve a mechanic
