# [P6: Nidhogg and Hraesvelgr](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=426762112878561&preview=1)

{/* todo: Images */}

This phase features a simultaneous fight against **Nidhogg** (West) and **Hraesvelgr** (East), who remain fixed in place with omnidirectional hitboxes. Each dragon has its own tank and must be handled carefully.

> Tanks must establish aggro quickly—both dragons will auto-attack and continue doing so throughout the phase.

## Phase Wide Mechanics

**Solemn Vow** – If any player is killed by **Hraesvelgr**, his **Solemn Vow** is broken. This grants him a permanent damage up and damage taken down buff, effectively a soft enrage. He will begin one-shotting anyone he hits.

**Wyrmsclaw** – High-damage auto-attacks used by both dragons. Tanks should be ready to mitigate and be topped between mechanics.

**HP Sync Requirement** – Both dragons must have their HP within **3% of each other** at specific moments (especially during **Akh Afah**). If the difference is too large, one stack becomes lethal and triggers a soft enrage (similar to TEA's Hand of Pain).

**Mortal Vow** – A debuff that will be passed between players throughout the fight. It reduces the
affected player's healing output (not healing received) and explodes in an AoE when it expires. If
another player is in this AoE, they receive the debuff. If not passed, **Nidhogg** will soft enrage
similar to **Hraesvelgr**.

### Mortal Vow

**Mortal Vow** is a debuff applied to a random DPS shortly after the phase begins. It must be **passed four times** throughout the phase.

- When **Mortal Vow** expires, it deals AoE damage and attempts to pass to the nearest player.
- If **no one is in range**, or if the player dies while holding it, **Nidhogg enrages**.
- If **multiple players** are hit, only one receives the debuff. The others are afflicted with **Suppuration**, reducing their max HP by 50% and increasing damage taken.

> Mortal Vow applies a DoT and **reduces healing output**, making it dangerous for support jobs to hold.  
> The original carrier also gains **Mortal Atonement**, preventing them from receiving the debuff again.

**Standard passing order** (XTTMC):

- Random DPS → G1 Tank → G2 Tank → G1 Melee → Caster
- If G1 Melee receives the first Vow, G2 Melee takes their spot later

### Light Parties

Assign your light parties for the entire phase:

- **Group 1 (Left):** Focus **Nidhogg**
- **Group 2 (Right):** Focus **Hraesvelgr**

Keeping party splits consistent ensures clean **Akh Afah** stack resolutions and helps balance **damage output** between the two dragons.

## Wyrmsbreath 1

Shortly after the phase begins, both dragons will cast **Wyrmsbreath**, the first major mechanic.
{/* todo: Image */}

- The **outer arena** is covered by a donut AoE (**Swirling Blizzard** from Hraesvelgr).
- Both bosses tether to **three random non-tank players** each with elemental breath tethers:
  - **Nidhogg** → **Dread Wyrmsbreath** (Fire Breath)
  - **Hraesvelgr** → **Great Wyrmsbreath** (Ice Breath)
- Each tether resolves as a **conal AoE** that applies debuffs based on the element:
  - **Boiling** → becomes **Pyretic** (moves = damage)
  - **Freezing** → becomes **Deep Freeze** (immobilized)
- To avoid these effects, **each non-tank must be hit by both breath types**, canceling the elemental debuffs.

---

### Tether Resolution

Tethers are **proximity-based** and must be stretched to avoid lethal damage. A colored indicator shows whether you're close (bad) or far (safe). Position carefully to bait opposite elements within your pair.

Players will form **three pairs** across the southern part of the arena:

- **Melees**: Near the **1 marker**, close to both dragons' breath angles
- **Group 1 Ranged/Healer**: Southwest
- **Group 2 Ranged/Healer**: Southeast

Within each pair:

- One player anchors in a known position
- The other adjusts (flexes) based on which dragon tethers them
  {/* todo: Explain flexes better idk */}
  > Positioning is tight. Use the donut telegraph and the **brick lines** across the center of the arena to help space your pair without overlapping others.

### Tank Busters (Simultaneous)

{/* todo: Images */}
While the party handles tethers, each dragon will also cast a **tank buster**. There are two variants depending on whether one or both dragons’ mouths are glowing:

1. **Both mouths glowing** → **Dark Orb & Holy Orb** (Split Tankbusters)

   - Each tank is targeted with a small AoE
   - Tanks **must stack together** in the middle to soak both orbs
   - Standing alone results in massive **Sustained DoTs** that will kill you

2. **One mouth glowing** → **Staggering Breath**
   - The glowing-mouth dragon casts a **conal AoE** down the **center** (Dark or Holy Breath)
   - The other dragon casts a **circular buster** on its target
   - Both tanks move to the **northern corner** of their respective dragon’s side, staying inside the donut AoE but avoiding the center

> If done correctly, no one will clip with AoEs, and tanks won’t overlap.

### Summary of Responsibilities

- **Tanks**: Mitigate autos, grab aggro, watch for glowing mouths, move appropriately
- **Non-tanks**: Stretch tethers, match with opposite element partner, avoid overlapping others
- **Everyone**: Watch for donut AoE boundaries and use the brick lines for alignment

### Mortal Vow Assignment

Once **Wyrmsbreath 1** resolves, a random **DPS** will be afflicted with **Mortal Vow**—a debuff that must be passed later in the phase.

To prepare:

- **DPS** should **spread** to avoid accidentally splashing the Vow AoE.
- **Supports (healers/tank)** can group near the middle to prepare for healing and avoid **Mortal Vow**.
  {/* todo: Images */}
  > Passing order typically follows: DPS → G1 Tank → G2 Tank → G1 Melee → Caster  
  > (Swap to G2 Melee if G1 received the first Vow.)

## Akh Afah 1

Immediately after Mortal Vow is applied, both dragons begin casting **Akh Afah**—massive stack mechanics that must be handled in **light parties**.

- Each dragon will target one **healer** with a stack marker
- These hits deal **heavy magic damage** and inflict **Magic Vulnerability Up**
- If both groups overlap, the result is instant death

The dragons also tether to one another at the beginning of the cast if their HP difference exceeds 3%:

- **White tether** = **Hraesvelgr** has more HP
- **Purple tether** = **Nidhogg** has more HP

> If the tether **persists until the end of the cast**, the **higher-HP dragon’s stack** will become **lethal**, wiping the party.

- **Group 1**: North (Nidhogg side)
- **Group 2**: South (Hraesvelgr side)

> This split mirrors your damage assignment and keeps tethers and stacks clean.

## Hallowed Wings 1

{/* todo: Images */}
After **Akh Afah**, **Nidhogg** will fly to the **North or South**, on either the **East or West** side of the arena. From this position, he will prepare **Cauterize**, cleaving **half the arena** in a straight line.

Simultaneously, **Hraesvelgr** will cast **Hallowed Wings**:

- One of his wings will glow, indicating which **half of the arena** will be **covered by a lethal AoE**
- The **non-glowing side** is safe

Together, these mechanics leave only a **single quadrant of the arena safe**.

> The party should start **near the center** to react quickly.

### Hallowed Plume: Tankbusters

{/* todo: Images */}
Hraesvelgr will also cast **Hallowed Plume**, a tankbuster targeting **two players** based on his **head position**:

- **Head up**: Targets the **two furthest** players → **Tanks go far**, **party stays close**
- **Head down**: Targets the **two closest** players → **Tanks stay close**, **party spreads far**

Each buster is a large circular AoE that **must be taken solo**.

Tanks should:

- Maintain distance between each other to avoid overlapping AoEs
- Avoid clipping the party
- Stay within their assigned dragon’s hitbox if possible
- Use mitigation

> The party should react based on the **head position**:
>
> - Head up = **Tanks far**, **Party stays close**
> - Head down = **Tanks close**, **Party spreads out**

### Mortal Vow 1st Pass

After all cleaves and tankbusters resolve, the **first Mortal Vow pass** will occur.

- The **DPS with the debuff** should move to **center**
- The assigned **G1 tank** steps in to take the AoE and receive the Vow
- All other players must avoid the center to prevent **Suppuration**

> Passing requires precise positioning—only one player should be within the explosion radius.

## Wroth Flames

{/* todo: Images */}
**Hraesvelgr** jumps to one of three positions: **Far West**, **Middle**, or **Far East**, and either **North or South**.  
He then casts **Cauterize**, cleaving the area in front of him.

- If he’s Far East/West: He cleaves **half the arena**
- If he’s Middle: He cleaves the **center third**, leaving safe zones along the **East and West walls**

At the same time, **three orbs** spawn in sequence and will **explode in a cross pattern** (Flame Burst):

1. Center
2. One corner
3. Opposite corner

Each orb explodes in a large **plus-shaped AoE** across the arena. Getting hit inflicts **moderate damage** and **Damage Down**.

### Debuff Assignments

{/* todo: Images */}
Players will receive one of three debuffs:

- **4 players**: 🔴 **Spreading Flames** – Small AoE spread on expiration (lethal if overlapped)
- **2 players**: ⚪ **Entangled Flames** – 2-player stack required on expiration
- **2 players**: No debuff – Must **pair with a White** debuffed player for stack

All debuffs resolve after the final Flame Burst.

### Akh Morn

While dodging AoEs, **Nidhogg** casts **Akh Morn** on a random player:

- Requires an **8-player stack**
- Hits **4 times**
- Leaves **persistent puddles** that apply a **Lethal Bleed** if stepped in

### Strategy Summary

{/* todo: Images */}

1. **Start near a corner** of the safe zone (based on Hraesvelgr’s position and first orb)
2. **Dodge to center** after first Flame Burst
3. **Stack for Akh Morn** and move as a group after each hit:
   - Use a **“J-path”** to curve around puddles and finish on the third hit
4. **After the fourth hit**, **players spread** for their debuffs:
   - 🔴 Red (Spreading Flames) → Spread out toward **Nidhogg**
   - ⚪ White (Entangled Flames) + No Debuff pairs → Stack together **toward Hraesvelgr**

### NA Marker Strat (Optional)

{/* todo: Images */}
NA Party Finder often uses Target Markers to assign spread positions:

- 🔴 Spreads = “Target to Attack” 1–4 (West to East)
- ⚪ White + No Debuff Pair 1 = “Target to Ignore”
- ⚪ White + No Debuff Pair 2 = “Target to Bind”

> The markers form a lineup from West to East:
> **Attack 1, 2, 3, 4**, then **Ignore**, then **Bind**

### Mortal Vow – 2nd Pass

After **Wroth Flames** and all debuffs resolve, the second **Mortal Vow** pass takes place.

- The **current holder** (G1 Tank) moves to center
- The **next recipient** (G2 Tank) steps in to take the pass
- All other players should stay away from center to avoid **Suppuration**

> Make sure no party members drift into center during this pass—losing a tank to Suppuration is nearly unrecoverable.

## Akh Afah 2

Once the second pass resolves, the dragons will cast another **Akh Afah**, identical in structure to the first.

- Each healer is targeted by a **stack marker**
- Players must group into **light parties** to split the damage
- The dragons’ HP must be kept within **3%** of each other

If they’re unbalanced:

- **Purple tether** = Nidhogg has more HP
- **White tether** = Hraesvelgr has more HP
  {/* todo: Image tether */}
  If the tether **persists** when the cast finishes, the **higher-HP dragon’s** stack becomes **lethal**, wiping the group.

### Positioning Reminder:

- **Group 1**: North (Nidhogg)
- **Group 2**: South (Hraesvelgr)

> This is the **final HP check**—after this, HP balance no longer matters until the end of the phase.

## Hallowed Wings 2

{/* todo: Images */}
After **Akh Afah 2**, the dragons combine multiple AoEs in a coordinated attack:

- **Hraesvelgr** casts **Hallowed Wings** (one side of the arena becomes lethal)
- **Hraesvelgr** also casts **Hallowed Plume** (two-player tankbuster based on proximity)
- **Nidhogg** casts either **Hot Wing** or **Hot Tail**:
  - **Hot Wing**: Cleaves North & South → Safe zone is **center strip**
  - **Hot Tail**: Cleaves center → Safe zones are **North or South**

All of these resolve simultaneously, leaving **one safe quadrant**, based on:

1. Which **Hraesvelgr wing glows**
2. Whether his **head is raised or lowered**
3. Nidhogg’s **cast bar** (Hot Wing or Hot Tail)

### Resolution Flow

{/* todo: Images */}

1. **Check Hraesvelgr’s glowing wing** → move to **non-glowing side**
2. **Check his head position**:
   - **Head up** = Tankbusters target **furthest** players → **Tanks far, party close**
   - **Head down** = Tankbusters target **closest** players → **Tanks close, party far**
3. **Check Nidhogg’s cast**:
   - **Hot Wing** → Move into **center line** → In
   - **Hot Tail** → Move toward **side lines** → Out

### Tank Positioning

{/* todo: Images */}
Both tanks must bait **Hallowed Plume** from within the **one remaining safe quadrant**, while adjusting to **head position** and **Hot Wing/Tail** restrictions:

- **Head Up (furthest)** → Tanks space out along the outer edges of the safe quadrant
- **Head Down (closest)** → Tanks stack closer to Hraesvelgr inside the safe zone

Avoid overlapping busters or party AoEs. The party should position **relative to the tanks** to maintain safe distance.

> There is no pre-defined “wall vs. center” rule—just adjust within the safe quadrant based on bait logic and avoid clipping anyone.

### Mortal Vow – 3rd Pass

Once the quadrant-cleave resolves, it's time for the **third Mortal Vow pass**.

- The **current holder** (G2 Tank) moves to the **center**
- The **next recipient** (G1 Melee or G2 Melee, depending on order) steps in
- As always, all other players should stay clear of center to prevent Suppuration

> This pass occurs quickly after Hallowed Wings 2, so coordinate positions beforehand to avoid hesitation or overlap.

## Wyrmsbreath 2

Immediately after the pass, **Wyrmsbreath 2** begins—but unlike the first, players are **not** meant to cancel their debuffs.

- Each non-tank will be tethered to **either Nidhogg (fire)** or **Hraesvelgr (ice)**
- These tethers still require **stretching** to prevent lethal damage
- However, players **should only be hit by one element**
  - Getting hit by both elements will **cancel your debuff**
  - This is **not desired** for the next mechanic

> This version is often called **Static WB2** in Party Finder

### Positioning Overview (Static WB2)

- Each player has a **preset position**, usually based on a visual layout (see below)
- Players spread around the arena to safely stretch their tethers and only be hit by **one breath**
- Tanks handle their busters as before:
  - **Both mouths glowing** → stack mid
  - **One mouth glowing** → tanks move to respective corners to avoid center cleave

![Wyrmsbreath 2 Positioning](/images/ultimates/dsr/static-wb2.png)

> Players must retain their **Fire or Ice debuff** for the next mechanic, so do not stack with an opposite element.

## Cauterize & Touchdown

After **Wyrmsbreath 2** resolves, each player will retain either a **Fire** or **Ice** debuff:

- **Boiling** → becomes **Pyretic** (any movement = damage)
- **Freezing** → becomes **Deep Freeze** (immobilized)

To remove these:

- Players must be hit by the **opposite dragon’s dive** (Cauterize)

### 🐉 Dive Resolution

Both dragons will dive across the arena:

- **Nidhogg** and **Hraesvelgr** appear at the **North wall**
- Each charges through the arena with **Cauterize**, dealing **heavy damage**
- Being hit by the **correct element**:
  - **Cleanses your debuff**
  - Prevents DoT application (Burns/Frostbite)
- Being hit by the **same element** applies a **DoT** and can be lethal

> Players must go to the dragon of the **opposite element** from their tether earlier

### Tank Role

Each dragon targets the **first player in line** with a **heavy tankbuster** on impact. This must be handled via:

- **Tank invulns**
- **Heavy mitigation** + shields

> Healers must be alert: this buster applies a **strong DoT** on top of the dive damage. Losing a tank here will likely trigger **Hraesvelgr’s enrage** due to Solemn Vow.

### Touchdown

Immediately after, both dragons land:

- **Nidhogg** → lands at **center**, dealing **proximity-based AoE**
- **Hraesvelgr** → lands from the **South wall**, also dealing AoE

Players should:

- **Group near the North wall** to minimize damage from both impacts
- Be fully healed and shielded before the landings

### Mortal Vow – Final Pass

Immediately after Touchdown, the **fourth and final pass** of **Mortal Vow** occurs.

- The current **melee** moves to the wall to drop the explosion
- The final recipient (usually **caster**) steps in to receive it

> After this pass, the Vow mechanic is complete. No further passing is required.

## Revenge of the Horde

As a final check, both dragons begin casting **Revenge of the Horde**—a synchronized enrage cast.

- Both **Nidhogg** and **Hraesvelgr** must be defeated **before** the cast finishes
- Focus remaining DPS and potions to push damage
- Apply raid-wide mitigation and healing if necessary

> If Thordan was spared in Phase 5, you will proceed to **Phase 7**.  
> If he was killed, you loop back to Phase 4 but will not have the tools require to kill the Eyes.{/* todo: Explain better if we want idk, lore nerd */}

## Transition: Alternative End

Before Phase 7 begins, **Dragon-king Thordan** initiates a cinematic sequence with multiple heavy-hitting raidwides.

- Two large AoEs hit the party and apply **unavoidable Bleeds**.
- These Bleeds cannot be mitigated and require spot healing—**do not** use strong party mitigation like **TBN** or **Panhaima** here.

After the second Bleed resolves, Thordan casts **Alternative End**, a massive raid-wide that **must** be mitigated.

> Apply mitigation **immediately after** the second Bleed expires.
> Using mitigation too early will leave the party vulnerable during **Alternative End**.

When this sequence is survived, the arena will shift, and the final encounter with **Dragon-king Thordan** will begin.
