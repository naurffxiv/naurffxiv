# Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate) In-Depth Guide

![Thordan](/images/thumbnails/ultimate/Thordan.png)

Welcome to NAUR's in-depth guide for Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate).

This guide will cover each phase in detail and provide tips to help you clear and understand the fight.
All of the strategies featured in this guide follow NA PF Strats.
These strats are commonly referred to as APD or NAUR strats.

If you have any questions regarding this guide, please feel free to join our
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/naurffxiv) and ask them.
Any issues or concerns can also be reported on the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/naurffxiv/naurffxiv).

## Pre-Fight Notes

Before reading the guide, there are a couple things to note about the fight:

1. To unlock DSR, you will need to have cleared "**Asphodelos: The Fourth Circle (Savage)**" and then
   speak to the Wandering Minstrel in Old Sharlayan.

2. When entering the instance, all players should try to be equipped with Best in Slot (BiS) gear
   as well as the highest tier of food and tinctures available. BiS gear is not entirely required
   to clear the fight but it will make the fight easier and more manageable with mistakes.
   Feel free to refer to the
   [NAUR - Current FFXIV Ultimate BiS Sets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V5HIN_yUxc-PIQQDv8zKkQ9TQNZ3OxQc66AxKIC_KaQ)
   spreadsheet for some example sets.

3. To better utilize this guide, please refer to the resources found in the
   [DSR resource page](/ultimate/dsr). Many resources such as raidplans, mitigation plans,
   cheat sheets, and more can be found there.

4. It should also be noted that if a player fails a mechanic in this fight, they will often
   receive a "**Damage Down**".

   > The "**Damage Down**" debuff in DSR will reduce the damage dealt by the player by 50% for 3 minutes.
   > In most cases, it is recommended for players to die when they receive this debuff as the
   > "**Weakness**" debuff is shorter and reduces less damage. This is not always the case as some
   > mechanics will require you to stay alive to resolve them but good to keep in mind.

5. All phases and major mechanics follow the Raidplans and Toolboxes found in the
   [DSR resource page](/ultimate/dsr). These links are also attached to the respective phase or mechanic headings.
   If a heading is underlined with a hyperlink, it will take you to the respective toolbox or raidplan.

## [P1: Adelphel, Grinnaux and Charibert](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=802461081524561&preview=1#1)
{/* todo: Images */}

Phase 1 features **Ser Adelphel** (Paladin), **Ser Grinnaux** (Warrior), and **Ser Charibert** (Black Mage).
Only **Ser Adelphel** and **Ser Grinnaux** are initially targetable.

Notes before pulling:

1. Decide tank assignments. Each tank typically handles their assigned boss's tank busters.
2. Plan tank mitigation for the bosses' auto attacks. Note that Grinnaux's autos hit harder than Adelphel's.
3. Be sure to interrupt Adelphel's "**Holiest Hallowing**" cast (occurs three times).

   > This cast must be interrupted or the bosses will be healed, making the phase impossible.

Order of interrupts is: Adelphel Tank > Phys. Ranged > Adelphel Tank.

Pull both bosses center and focus DPS on Adelphel. The phase begins with "**Holiest of Holy**",
a heavy-hitting raidwide. Afterward, **Ser Adelphel** spawns a tether on a random player,
consisting of two tank busters: "**Holy Shield Bash**" and "**Holy Bladedance**".

The tank who has aggro of him will take this tether north using invulnerability while the party
stacks south to avoid cleave damage. A few moments after the tether spawns, both **Ser Grinnaux**
and **Ser Charibert** will cast mechanics of their own as the tether resolves.

**Ser Grinnaux's** cast is "**Empty Dimension**". This is a donut AoE that originates from him.
The party will need to make sure to be close to him.

**Ser Charibert's** cast is "**Heavensblaze**". This is a small AoE that will target a random party member.
The more players that stand in the AoE, the less damage it will do so the party should be stacked.

### Hyperdimensional Slashes
{/* todo: Images */}
After the tank buster and AoEs, **Ser Adelphel** jumps to the arena's side becoming immune to damage while
**Ser Grinnaux** dashes center for two sets of "**Hyperdimensional Slashes**".
Four random party members will be marked with orange markers above their player model while four
others will remain unmarked.

The markers signify party members that are being targeted for a "**Hyperdimensional Slash**".
These slashes fire a line AoE in the direction of the marked party members.
The line AoE will also drop a "**Portal**" at the end of the line AoE.

> If these "**Portals**" are too close to one another or if a party member gets too close to them,
> they will explode and deal damage to the party. This will also apply a "**Damage Down**" debuff
> to the players hit by the explosion.

The four marked party members will need to spread in a way to avoid clipping other party members
and place the "**Portals**" far enough away from each other. To avoid clipping the unmarked players,
the first set of slashes will be taken on the north side of the arena. If the party is using the markers
from the DSR resource page, they are placed precisely so you can stand in the middle of them to avoid
the other marked players.

> There is no priority for spread positions. Try to preposition to where you want to go to avoid confusion.

The party members who are not targeted for slashes will need to stack south on the tip of the middle
diamond to bait a conal, shared AoE from **Ser Grinnaux**. One party member who is not marked is randomly
chosen to be the target of the shared AoE.

Both the line AoEs and the shared AoE will go off at the same time. As both initial mechanics resolve,
the unmarked party members will now be marked and the marked players will no longer be marked.
The new marked players will need to spread on the south side of the arena just as the other players
did on the north side while the north side stacks to share the conal AoE.

> To make the south spreads a bit easier, you can slightly preposition to the marker you want to go to
> when sharing the previous stack.

### Ser Adelphel Dashes
{/* todo: Images */}
After the second set of "**Hyperdimensional Slashes**", **Ser Adelphel** will jump to a random cardinal
direction starting the next mechanic.

The party should position opposite of **Ser Adelphel** and prepare for a knockback from **Ser Grinnaux**:
**Faith Unmoving**. The party should use KB prevention to avoid being knocked into the wall or the
**"Portals"**. **Ser Grinnaux** will also cast another "**Holiest of Holy**" raidwide as the knockback goes off.

After the knockback, **Ser Adelphel** will dash around the arena in an hourglass formation dropping
"**Bright Flare**" orbs as he dashes. These orbs will explode after a short time.
The first dash will always be to a cardinal direction left or right of him.

To avoid the exploding orbs and his dashes, the party will need to move in the direction where he
initially dashes to. While moving in that direction, the party should be aiming for the green,
triangle-shaped marking on the floor at one of the intercardinal directions.

> Be sure not to be too far out or too far in while moving. The "**Portals**" can still explode if
> someone is too close, or you can get hit by the dash and orbs from **Ser Adelphel**.

Once **Ser Adelphel** finishes his dashes, he will follow up with a tank buster on whoever has
aggro of him. This tank buster knocks anyone back into the wall of death who is near the tank
taking the tank buster. The tank with **Ser Adelphel** should move away from the party as the
last dashes go off to avoid sending anyone into the wall.

When the dashes and tank buster have resolved, **Ser Adelphel** will attempt to cast
"**Holiest Hallowing**" that should be interrupted by the tank with aggro. The other tank
can interrupt if the tank with aggro is unable to.

### PlayStation Markers and Chains
{/* todo: Images */}
Take both bosses to the center of the room and prepare for the next mechanic.
Tanks will need to make sure that the bosses are centered as much as possible, especially **Ser Grinnaux**.

Every party member will be marked with a PlayStation marker above their head and be chained to
a party member with the same marker.

- **Tanks**: Can receive Blue "X" or Purple Square.
- **Healers**: Can receive a Blue "X" or Green Triangle.
- **DPS**: Can receive a Red Circle, Purple Square, or Green Triangle.

> The chains need to be broken before they expire or they will one-shot the players.
> Tanks can survive but receive damage down.

Before chains and markers are applied, the party should try to be as close to the center of the
arena as possible. The closer the party is to their partner when the chain is applied, the easier
it will be to break the chain.

A couple moments after the markers are applied, **Ser Grinnaux** will cast another "**Faith Unmoving**"
knockback. Shortly after the knockback, **Ser Charibert** will cast an AoE on each party member.

To resolve the mechanic, a couple steps must be followed:

1. Move to the middle of the arena and prepare to be chained and marked.

2. Move to assigned position once marked and prepare for knockback.

As stated above, only certain roles will get certain markers. Each marker has a predetermined position
that is role dependent:
{/* todo: Look at maybe redoing this section with images or markdown */}
Blue "X" Positions

- Tank - North
- Healer - South

Green Triangle Positions

- DPS - North West
- Healer - South East

Purple Square Positions

- Tank - North East
- DPS - South West

Red Circle Positions

- Red Circle DPS Furthest West - West
- Red Circle DPS Furthest East - East

These positions ensure that your partner will always be across from you during the knockback to break the chain.

3. Prepare for the knockback from **Ser Grinnaux**.

> If positioned correctly, the knockback will send you to the edge of the arena, breaking the chain.
> Make sure to not be far out and inline with **Ser Grinnaux**. If not properly positioned with him,
> you may get knocked back towards another player. It is common for tanks to not have him properly
> positioned so adjust as needed.

Warriors should note that Inner Release knockback prevention will prevent them from being knocked back
if the buff is active.

4. Adjust position to avoid the AoE from **Ser Charibert** and prepare for the next mechanic.

As players are knocked back, the spread AoE will go off on each party member. If positioned correctly,
the players should be in position to take their AoE. Make sure to be close to the wall and adjust away
from players to avoid overlapping.

Tanks should bring the bosses back to the center of the room after resolving the PlayStation Markers,
chains, and spreads.

The party will need to group up for heals and keep the bosses around the same HP. Another
"**Holiest Hallowing**" will be cast which needs to be interrupted by the Phys. Ranged.

> If the Phys. Ranged is unable to interrupt, the **Ser Grinnaux** tank can interrupt if they have not already.

After the interrupt, **Ser Adelphel** will cast another "**Holiest of Holy**" raidwide while
**Ser Grinnaux** will cast a "**Full Dimension**" or "**Empty Dimension**" AoE. This is the same mechanic
at the start of the phase but it can either be a donut or point-blank AoE. Full is out, Empty is in.
After the raidwide, yet another "**Holiest Hallowing**" will be cast which needs to be interrupted by the Tank.
A final "**Holiest of Holy**" will be cast after the interrupt.

Finally, the "**The Bull's Steel**" will be cast. This is an enrage cast that gives them invulnerability,
damage buffs, and fully heals them, making the phase impossible to clear. Both bosses need to be defeated
at the same time or the one who did not die with the other will cast a quick enrage.

### Planar Prison
{/* todo: Images */}
Once both bosses are defeated, they jump to the west side of the arena along with **Ser Charibert**
to pull you into the center of a death wall. While in this "**Planar Prison**", all party members
will be chained to **Ser Grinnaux** and movement speed will be reduced.

"**Haurchefant**" will spawn outside the arena, blocking an incoming attack that will cause raid-wide
damage until he is killed. "**Haurchefant**" will also have a healing debuff called "**HP Recovery Down**",
preventing him from being healed.

Throughout this mechanic, **Ser Charibert** will be casting "**Pure of Heart**", which is the enrage cast.
To beat this enrage, you must get him below 30% before the cast is finished.

During this time, four sets of two conal AoEs will be triggered in succession, emanating from **Ser Charibert**.
These cones are baited and hit the two closest party members to him. Once a party member is hit, they will be
applied with a "**Light Resistance Down**" debuff and "**Skyblind**", a puddle debuff that will drop a puddle
under them once "**Skyblind**" expires.

To resolve this mechanic, two sets of party members need to bait the cones south, away from the party,
who should stack north of **Ser Charibert**. The bait order is: Healers > Melee > Ranged > Tanks

After a cone is baited, move to one side of the party to drop the puddle debuff. Healers and Ranged will
drop their puddles left of **Ser Charibert**, facing him. Melee and Tanks will drop their puddles right
of **Ser Charibert**, facing him. Tanks can alternatively drop the puddles where they took the bait as
they are the last ones.

Once all baits have been taken, the cast will finish, resulting in a raid-wide AoE. If **Ser Charibert**
reaches below 30%, you will continue on to the next phase. If not, the raid-wide will kill you, sending
you back to the start of the phase.

The arena will transition to Phase 2 and **King Thordan** will spawn. Make sure to tag and hit him.
Not doing so will send you back to Phase 1.

---

## [P2: King Thordan]((https://raidplan.io/plan/NDX-6bF2djrDMB-v))
{/* todo: Images */}

The start of Phase 2 acts as a "checkpoint" for any future wipes. Any wipe from now on will send you
to the start of Phase 2 rather than Phase 1. Markers should also be replaced with the second set of
markers found in the [DSR resource page](/ultimate/dsr).

For the remainder of the fight, light parties will be used for positioning. Positions are always
light party based.

Tanks should refer to the [NAUR Mitigation Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YJX933Fe6MeNv06QVQfRUI3oJVfCvm4OqOyLCSjcAJk/edit?usp=sharing).
Tank cooldowns are extremely important in this fight and need to be followed.

### Start of Phase 2

At the start of Phase 2, **King Thordan** begins with 3 heavy-hitting auto attacks that cleave the
targeted tank.

> Note that throughout the fight, **King Thordan's** auto attacks always cleave.

After his auto attacks, **King Thordan** casts "**Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**" - a baited protean AoE
that will kill anyone hit by it. Everyone except the MT should stack south of the boss to bait all
proteans in the same direction. Once the cast finishes, the party and main tank dodge to the side to
avoid the proteans before returning to original positions.

**King Thordan** follows with a tank buster, "**Ascalon's Might**". This hits 3 times and cleaves.
After the TB, **King Thordan** begins casting "**Strength of the Ward**", the first major mechanic
of Phase 2.

### Strength of the Ward
{/* todo: Images */}
"**Strength of the Ward**" has multiple moving parts which is broken down into parts for easier
understanding.

#### Strength of the Ward: Part 1

Once Thordan finishes casting, he jumps and becomes untargetable.
The first part involves four simultaneous mechanics:

- Three Knights spawn at random cardinals/intercardinals and cast "**Spiral Thrust**". They then dash
  across the arena, knocking anyone in their path into the wall of death.
- **King Thordan** targets everyone with "**Lightning Storm**" - a small AoE that kills players if
  overlapped.
- **Ser Guerrique** (Warrior) spawns at a random position in the center and casts "**Heavy Impact**" -
  an AoE that creates expanding rings.
- **King Thordan** prepares another "**Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**" as the party dodges the rings.

First, identify the safe spots from the knights' dashes. There are always 2 "pizza slices" that are
safe and opposite each other. These are determined by the floor markers' color and will always be the
same color if using standard markers.

Since one pizza slice can't fit everyone, the party must split into light parties:

- "**Light Party One**" goes to the side with number markers.
- "**Light Party Two**" goes to the side with letter markers.

Within these safe spots, spread to avoid "**Lightning Storm**" overlap:

- **Healers**: Align on the tri-force icon on the wall.
- **Tanks**: Position in front of healers using the blue line as a guide.
- **DPS**: Position 5 notches away from the healer. Melee to the healer's left (facing in);
  Ranged/Caster to the healer's right (facing in).

After "**Lightning Storm**" resolves, the knights' "**Spiral Thrust**" and **Ser Guerrique's**
"**Heavy Impact**" rings activate. For dodging the rings, see Borunks' YouTube video for visual guidance.
It's quite hard to explain in text, but the goal is to avoid the expanding rings while staying in the
safe spots. Step into the ring only once, staying in line with your group.

As you move in, note that two **Paladins** will spawn in the arena. Keep note of which direction they
are facing as the side furthest from them is where **King Thordan** will appear for the next part of
the mechanic.

**King Thordan** will appear in the center of the arena and still untargetable. He will cast another
"**Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**" targeting everyone with protean AoEs. Move as a line without fanning
out to avoid clipping others. Step left or right when the cast finishes to dodge.

#### Strength of the Ward: Part 2
{/* todo: Image */}
After "**Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**" resolves, **King Thordan** will jump to a random cardinal or
intercardinal position outside the arena. He will appear on the side furthest from where the two
**Paladins** are facing. **Thordan's** position should be considered "**Relative North**" for this
part of the mechanic.

Multiple mechanics occur simultaneously:

- Three players will be marked with blue circles above their heads for "**Skyward Leap**" (large
  defamation AoEs).
- One non-tank who is not targeted for "**Skyward Leap**" will be selected for a party stack,
  "**The Dragon's Rage**".
- Two tank tethers will spawn from the **Paladins** (same as P1's "**Holy Shield Bash/Holy Bladedance**"
  combo).
- Dark AoE puddles will appear, forcing players to the arena edges to resolve mechanics.
- Six towers will spawn that need to be soaked after "**Skyward Leap**" and "**The Dragon's Rage**".

Tanks should grab their designated tether. Facing **King Thordan**, Main Tank takes the right tether,
Off Tank takes the left. These tethers deal less damage when stretched farther, so cross them and
bring them toward **King Thordan**. Tanks should end up to Thordan's left and right, facing the
tethers outward away from the group.

"**Skyward Leap**" marked players must immediately move to designated safe spots at the new south,
east, and west sides of the arena (treating **King Thordan** as **Relative North**).

There's no priority for these spots - go to the closest one while being aware of other marked players.
To avoid grabbing tank tethers, take the long route around the **Paladins** rather than cutting
between them. Do not move into the tanks' path to **King Thordan**.

Position precisely to avoid hitting others:

- South marker: Stand at the edge of the wall in line with the tri-force.
- East and west markers: Stand 2-3 notches away from **Relative North** (where Thordan is).

Non-tanks without "**Skyward Leap**" markers stack near **King Thordan** at the wall to share
"**The Dragon's Rage**". They should also preposition on the wall (left/right/middle) to indicate
which tower they'll take.

After all these mechanics resolve, six towers will spawn. Tanks will be down and unable to soak towers.
All non-tanks will take their assigned/claimed tower.

Once towers are soaked, **King Thordan** casts "**Ancient Quaga**", a heavy-hitting raidwide that ends
Strength of the Ward.
Before the next major mechanic, **King Thordan** performs two tank busters:
First, "**Heavenly Heel**", a heavy-hitting tankbuster that inflicts the main tank with
"**Slashing Resistance Down**". This is immediately followed up by "**Ascalon's Might**", which will
kill the tank unless swapped or an invulnerability skill is used.

After the tank busters, **King Thordan** will cast "**Sanctity of the Ward**", the next major mechanic.
{/* todo: Images */}
### Sanctity of the Ward
{/* todo: Images */}
#### Sanctity of the Ward: Part 1

For this section, light parties and role-based partners from the opposite light party will be needed:

Partners: Tank-Tank | Healer-Healer | Melee-Melee | Phys. Ranged-Caster

Key mechanics occurring simultaneously:

1. **Paladins** spawn east and west, with a **Dark Knight** at a random intercardinal.

2. Two players receive markers: "one sword" or "two swords crossed", indicating who the **Dark Knight**
   will target with "**Sacred Sever**". (Shared proximity damage that hits a total of four times, with
   each marked player being hit twice for a total of 4 hits. The further you are from the source, the
   less damage you will take).

3. The **Paladins** dash around the arena dropping explosive "**Brightorbs**".

4. **King Thordan** and "**The Eye**" cast gaze mechanics from outside the arena that inflict
   "**Damage Down**" and "**Hysteria**" on players if looked at. Hysteria causes your character to
   move uncontrollably in random directions. Looking at the eye also deals damage.

First, check for sword markers above players' heads:

- Marker 1 (one sword): Go to the wall directly across from the **Dark Knight** (plunged first)
- Marker 2 (crossed swords): Go to the wall directly behind the **Dark Knight** (plunged second)

If unmarked, check if your partner has a marker. Change groups only if you get an opposite number
from your initial light party or your partner receives your group's number.

Group positioning:

- Group 1: Position on the wall directly across from the **Dark Knight**
- Group 2: Position on the wall directly behind the **Dark Knight**

When prepositioning, note which way the **Paladins** are facing (clockwise or counterclockwise).
This determines your rotation direction for dodges. Preposition approximately 3-4 notches from the
fidget spinner on the wall. This initial positioning is crucial.

As mechanics begin, dodge the **Paladins** dashes by moving four notches in your rotation direction
to the first safe spot. Stay stacked for "**Sacred Sever**" damage sharing.

After the "**Brightorb**" in front of your party explodes, move into that space and continue 4-5
notches in the same direction (ending about 3 notches from the next tri-force). Remain stacked as
the **Dark Knight** completes its plunges.

When the plunges and dashes finish, prepare for the second part of the mechanic.

#### [Sanctity of the Ward: Part 2](https://raidplan.io/plan/Src8CpFxCAUUuZEM)
{/* todo: Markdown feels empty */}

For this part, split into pairs at each cardinal:

- Tank and Ranged: North and South (Group 1 North, Group 2 South)
- Healers and Melee: East and West (Group 1 West, Group 2 East)

Two players of the same role (Support or DPS) will get marked with "**Prey**".
These players will periodically drop 7 "**Meteors**" that cause minor raidwide damage.

"**Prey**" players will always occupy the North and South starting positions.
If marked, move clockwise to North or South unless already in a North or South position.
If someone occupies your rotation spot, continue clockwise to either North or South.

Each cardinal position forms a Support+DPS pair. These stacks will drop ice puddles when the
mechanic resolves. The ice puddles need to be shared by the pair - a player taking an ice puddle
solo will die. Fire puddles will appear on intercardinals. Standing in either puddle type causes
a deadly bleed.

As the phase continues, each pair should use body language to indicate which tower they intend to
take. This is especially important for East/West pairs, as they have more flexibility in tower
assignments. Players typically walk in the direction of their intended tower to communicate this.

Eight towers will spawn in the arena. Each quadrant will always have at least one outer tower
(at the wall). Each tower needs one player to absorb it.

Cardinal pairs are responsible for the towers in their quadrant, with these rules:

- Meteor role takes priority on outer wall towers and will always go out.
- If 2 wall towers are in your quadrant, both partners take the outside towers. Meteor role has
  priority on cardinal towers. If there is no cardinal tower, the meteor role takes the most
  clockwise tower.
- For inner towers, only one or no players from a pair go in; inner players take the closest tower
  clockwise. If no tower is initially clockwise, continue clockwise until finding an empty tower.

North/South meteor players should aim to be 180 degrees apart when possible, following this priority:
1. North/South (ideal)
2. 180 degrees in some other configuration (e.g., NE/SW)
3. Slightly cursed (e.g., North + SW)
4. Cursed (same sub-direction, e.g., NE/SE)

This body language is particularly critical in the "double outer tower" pattern where there are 4
towers at NE/NW and SE/SW positions.

After tower absorption, marked players must **immediately** begin moving clockwise around the arena
to drop meteors. Any delay will cause the meteors to spawn too close together and explode. The path
taken depends on the pattern:

- 180-degree pattern: Simply move from N→S or S→N
- Slightly cursed pattern: The player with less than 180 degrees should take the longest possible
  route, moving around the fire/ice puddles
- Cursed pattern: Requires specialized movement techniques (refer to video examples)

During meteor drops, another set of 8 towers spawns along the wall at cardinals and intercardinals.
Meteor roles take cardinal towers; non-meteor roles take intercardinal towers.

**Ser Grinnaux** will appear and begin casting "**Faith Unmoving**", which triggers a knockback.

- Outside players: **must** activate knockback immunity when **Ser Hermenost's** Conviction cast
  reaches the "C" in the castbar, or after the 5th meteor drops.
- Inside players: can ride the knockback into their tower's position.

Once all towers are soaked, **Sanctity** ends. **Thordan** will appear to the north and cast
"**Ultimate End**", a heavy-hitting raidwide. After this, he receives the "**Discomposed**" debuff,
increasing his damage taken by 30%.

He will then cast two sets of "**Broad Swings**", each consisting of three slashes (similar to a
mini-trine or 3-1 dodge mechanic). Each set can be random, but the pattern always starts with either
**Left** or **Right** and finishes with **Back**. To dodge these:

1. Start behind **Thordan**.
2. Move into the safe spot for the first swing (the area he is not swinging at).
3. Wait until Thordan repositions and then readjust for the next swing.

Finally, **Thordan** begins his enrage cast "**Aetheric Burst**" and must be killed before it completes.

---

## [P3: Nidhogg](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=267799249146271&preview=1#)
{/* todo: Images */}
Once **Thordan** is defeated, the arena transitions into Phase 3, starting with a massive raid-wide AoE,
**"Final Chorus"**, from **Nidhogg** as he descends.

He will begin auto-attacking the main tank three times with cleaving line AoEs.
The tank should face the boss north at the A marker. **Nidhogg** will then cast
**"Dive from Grace"** aka _Wyrmhole_.

As **Nidhogg** finishes casts, each player is assigned a **numbered debuff** (1-3) determining the order
in which **Nidhogg's clone** will target them for a dive attack. Players are divided into:

- Three **"First in Line"** (I) debuffs
- Two **"Second in Line"** (II) debuffs
- Three **"Third in Line"** (III) debuffs

Each dive will spawn a tower 3 seconds after hitting the player, which must be soaked by another player.
A **Nidstinien clone** will appear at the tower's location, locking onto the closest player.
The soaker must face the clone away from the party to avoid cleaving others.

### Tower Placement & Arrows

Before the dives resolve, some players will receive an arrow debuff or no debuff, affecting where their
tower will spawn.

- **Up arrow** (**"Spineshatter Dive Target"**) → Tower spawns **in front** of the player.
- **Down arrow** (**"Elusive Jump Target"**) → Tower spawns **behind** the player.
- **No arrow** (**"High Jump Target"**) → Tower spawns **directly on** the player.

To simplify, follow the **Westhogg strategy**:

- **Arrow debuff** → Always face **west** before getting hit, ensuring towers spawn in predictable spots.

### Pre-Positioning

Before the mechanic resolves, players should claim spots:

- **(I)** players take the east/south/west spots.
- **(II)** players take the north-west/north-east spots.
- **(III)** players take the east/south/west spots.

Players assigned arrows should follow the following positioning: **down arrows** always take **west**,
**up arrows** take **east**, and **no arrows** take the **south** spot.

The dive and tower soak pattern follows a set order:

1. First set: (I) get hit, (III) soak towers.
2. Second set: (II) get hit, (I) east/west soak towers.
3. Third set: (III) get hit, (II) soak towers, and (I) soaks the south tower.

After the debuffs are applied, **Nidhogg** will begin casting **"Gnash and Lash"** or **"Lash and Gnash"**,
determining the in/out AoE pattern for the upcoming mechanic.

- "**Gnash**" = Out
- "**Lash**" = In

He will cast this mechanic twice during the phase. The pattern is not guaranteed to be reversed,
so players need to track the order for later mechanics. The first cast will happen during the
**First** (I) and **Third** (III) tower placements.

### Wyrmhole

#### First Stack

The party should stack on the boss's hitbox to soak the **"Eye of the Tyrant"**, which deals heavy
stack damage. Meanwhile, **(I)** players should position themselves at the edge of the hitbox to
prepare for tower placements.

> **Important**: Be mindful of **"Gnash and Lash"** timing, as it has a delayed execution after the cast bar.
> Always watch for the visual cue of **Nidhogg's** wings to know when to move.

Once a group is hit by the clones, they will lose their debuff and gain **"Fire Vulnerability"**,
preventing them from soaking the next set of towers.

As the **(III)** group moves into position to soak the towers that **(I)** previously placed,
**Nidhogg** will cast the second portion of **"Gnash and Lash"** again, with the order of the
attacks reversed.

After the towers are soaked, **Nidhogg's clones** will spawn at the soaked locations. They will
lock onto the closest player, and players must bait the clones' line AoEs towards the wall. Be sure
to dodge the second part of **"Gnash and Lash"** before the clones resolve.

While **(III)** are baiting the line AoEs, **(II)** should place their towers at max melee range
to the northeast and northwest, following their assigned arrows. At this point, **(III)** should
be preparing to drop their towers.

Once **(II)** has placed their towers, **(I)** who soaked the east and west towers should move to
soak the second set of east and west towers. After soaking, bait the clones outside towards the wall.
After baiting clones, **(I)** should swiftly move for the next stack.

#### Second Stack

A total of 5 players—the **2 (I) players** who soaked the northeast and northwest towers, the
**south (I)** who hasn't soaked a tower yet, and the **2 (II) players** who placed their towers—should
stack north on the boss's hitbox to take the second **"Eye of the Tyrant"**. **Nidhogg** will then
cast **"Gnash and Lash"** again.

After dodging the second part of **"Gnash and Lash"**, the **(II)** and **(I)** players who have not
yet soaked a tower will move to handle the **(III)** dropped towers and bait the Nidhogg clones one
last time. Meanwhile, the party should focus on resolving both parts of **"Gnash and Lash"** accordingly.

---

### Drachenlance

After all the clones are baited, the main tank must move away from the party to avoid cleaving auto-attacks.
The tank can either stand in front of where they last took their tower or move to an intercardinal position.

Two cleaving tank AA attacks will follow. Afterward, **Nidhogg** will face a random player and cast
**"Drachenlance"**, a 90-degree frontal cleave. Simply move away from the cleave before the cast ends.

Once **Drachenlance** is done, move with your meteor partner to the clockwise intercardinal from your
meteor position to prepare for tower soaks. One tower will spawn at each intercardinal, requiring 1-4
players to soak.

### Darkdragon Dive (Enumeration)

All eight players must be assigned to soak a tower. If a tank or melee's default tower requires only one player,
they must adjust by checking **clockwise**, then **counterclockwise**, and finally diagonally for a tower
that requires 3 or 4 soakers.

Three of the towers will spawn **Nidhogg clones**, which will lock onto the nearest player.
Ranged players should position themselves at the center of the tower to ensure the clones face them
and point them outward to avoid overlap. The clones will cast a line AoE, so after baiting them,
the party should collapse onto the **east** and **west** markers to prevent cleaving and create space
for **"Soul Tether"**.

### Soul Tether

One tower and the boss will **"Soul Tether"** to random players. Tanks should follow the
[mitigation sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YJX933Fe6MeNv06QVQfRUI3oJVfCvm4OqOyLCSjcAJk/edit?usp=sharing)
to handle this mechanic. If tethered to a tower, collapse east or west to ensure the tank can easily grab the tether.

> Tethers are the hardest hit in all of DSR and require comprehensive mitigation from tanks, as well as
> external cooldowns from healers. Tanks may also invuln the tethers to reduce the damage.

Tanks can safely resolve tethers in the following positions:

1. Under the boss (invuln if stacking together),
2. Under the tower that extended the tether (the size of the AoE is exactly the size of the base of the tower),
3. Directly north or south.

Once the clones and **"Soul Tether"** are dealt with, cleaving auto-attacks will resume, followed by one
final **"Drachenlance"**. If **Nidhogg** reaches 8% HP or lower before enrage, players should clear the
phase and move on to Phase 4.

---

## [P4: The Eyes](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=613699253336171&preview=1#)
{/* todo: Images */}
{/* fix: Rewrite some stuff */}
The arena will transition to Phase 4 after **Nidhogg** is defeated. This part of the guide follows the
[DSR Phase 4 - Eyes Toolbox](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=613699253336171&preview=1#).

At the start of this phase, everyone should stack on the **1 marker** to receive buffs from **Alphinaud**
and someone who will be randomly targeted for **"Soul of Friendship"**. These buffs will be required to
do damage during this phase.

{/* todo: Explain Each buffs what they do */}
{/* todo: Simplify  */}

Throughout this phase, players will be fighting the **Eyes of Nidhogg** that appear on the west and east
sides of the arena:
- **Blue Eye**: Always positioned west
- **Red Eye**: Always positioned east
{/* todo: Left/Right */}
### Initial Positioning

DPS should initially attack the **Blue Eye** while supports focus on the **Red Eye**. Tanks need to
establish aggro on both eyes as they perform auto-attacks throughout the phase. Ensure at least one
tank secures aggro on the **Blue Eye**.
{/* todo: OT/MT attribution ? */}

Shortly after receiving the buffs, **"Resentment"** will be cast, which is a raidwide AoE that applies
a bleed effect.
{/* todo: No Cast Bar */}

### Hatebound

Once the bleed effect expires, **"Hatebound"** will be cast. This mechanic tethers 4 players with blue
tethers and 4 players with red tethers. These tethers can be passed by standing on another player,
similar to mechanics like Rot, Nisi, or the role call debuff in P4S.

Ideal tether assignments: {/* todo: Reword */}
- **Melee and Tanks**: Should have Red tethers
- **Ranged and Healers**: Should have Blue tethers

> If you have the wrong color tether, stack on **Estinien** in the middle of the arena to pass it.
{/* todo: Rem quote + Specify */}

Once you have the correct tether, move to your predetermined position:

- **Melee/Tanks**: Position in front of YELLOW orbs
  - DPS west, Supports east
- **Ranged/Healers**: Position in front of BLUE orbs
  - DPS west, Supports east
- **Group 1**: North side
- **Group 2**: South side
{/* fix: fix chronogical order */}
### Blue and Yellow Orbs

As orbs grow for the first time, melee and tanks will pop their yellow orbs. After popping, they will
pass their tethers to the ranged and healers: {/* todo: rewrite */}
- **Group 1**: Pass tethers on the north side
- **Group 2**: Pass tethers on the south side
{/* todo: explain dodge */}
Once the tethers are swapped, melee and tanks can move to the **Blue Eye**, being careful to stay away
from the orbs on the north and south.

As the blue orbs grow again, Ranged and Healers will pop their orbs, then move west to the **Blue Eye**.
These players, that have red tethers, will form a box formation standing max melee at the intercardinals of it.
Healers on the east side, Ranged on the west side. 
The tanks and melee DPS that have blue tethers stack directly on the eye. {/* todo: those with blue tethers */}

For the next mechanic, you should aim to have the **Red Eye** at approximately 40% HP, as the upcoming mechanic
will deal 40% of its HP in damage.

### Mirage Dives

As the phase progresses, players with the red tether will begin receiving **"Mirage Dives**".
There will be 3 sets of 2 dives each:
- 2 Players with the Red debuff will be targeted with small-AoE dives
- 2 Players with the Blue debuff must approach the dive-targeted players and swap debuffs/positions with them
{/* todo: based on prio and turn */}

> **Note**: The **Red Eye** takes damage each time a player with a red debuff (those targeted by dives)
> takes damage. The tether passes can be finicky, so the person who just took the dive should wait until
> the tether is passed before moving to the middle.

Swap order: Tanks → Melee → First divers
{/* fix: fix chronogical order */}
To determine who to swap with, we use a "snake" priority system based on your light party:
- **Group 1 Swaps**: Northwest, moving counterclockwise
- **Group 2 Swaps**: Northeast, moving clockwise

After the 3rd dive, those who were hit by the first dive must go back out and swap with those who were
just hit. Priorities are as follows:
- Counterclockwise most 1st dive: Northwest, moving counterclockwise
- Clockwise most 1st dive: Northeast, moving clockwise

After the 4th dive, players may move freely.

### Enrage

Both Eyes will begin casting a raidwide AoE **"Steep In Rage"**. Healers should ensure all DPS are at
full HP. At least one eye must die before this cast completes, or the damage will be lethal without
heavy mitigation. {/* todo: If both are alive */}

If both eyes are defeated before **"Nidhogg's Influence**" reaches 100, you will see a cutscene transitioning
back to the first phase, leading into the Rewind mechanic.

## Intermission: Rewind  
{/* TODO: Add images for Planar layout, LB3 timing, and AoE baiting */}

This brief intermission mirrors the **Planar Prison** sequence from Phase 1, but with one crucial difference:  
you must _successfully_ **save Haurchefant** to proceed.

### Saving Haurchefant

Shortly into the phase (about 3 GCDs), **Haurchefant** will appear to block the **Spear of the Fury**.  
To protect him, a **Tank must use Limit Break 3** as soon as he lands.

- While LB3 is active, Haurchefant takes heavily reduced damage
- Healers must spot-heal him continuously to keep him alive
- Failing to keep Haurchefant alive will cause a loop to **Phase 1**

> If LB3 is delayed, **Pure of Heart** will kill Haurchefant and the party will wipe.

---

### Key Mechanics

- **Shockwave** – Constant raid-wide damage pulsing from Haurchefant as long as he's alive  
- **Brightwing** – Cast by **Charibert**, cleaves the two closest players with high damage conal AoEs, applying:
  - **Light Resistance Down**
  - **Skyblind**, which drops an invisible AoE under the target's position after 5s and explodes shortly after

- **Pure of Heart** – A long cast by Charibert.  
  Deals raid-wide damage based on **his remaining HP**. If he is above ~30% at the end of the cast, it will wipe the party.  
  Also hits **Haurchefant**, so he must be healed to near full HP.

---

### Final Check: Spear of the Fury

After **Pure of Heart** resolves, the **Planar Prison** fades.  
**The Spear of the Fury** becomes targetable and starts casting **Pierce**, an enrage that kills Haurchefant.

- Quickly stack on Haurchefant and **burst the spear** before the cast completes
- If the spear finishes casting, you will **return to Phase 2**

> If executed properly, Haurchefant survives, and the party proceeds to **Phase 5** after a short cutscene.


---

## P5: Dark King Thordan
{/* todo: Images */}
Phase 5 begins with **King Thordan** returning from Phase 2, now empowered and corrupted. 
He spawns in the center of the arena, facing south, and immediately performs two cleaving auto-attacks.

> The main tank should keep the boss facing south for this part, being careful not to cleave the party.

After the auto-attacks, **Thordan** begins casting **Wrath of the Heavens**, initiating the first major mechanic of the phase.

---

### [Wrath of the Heavens (Wrath)](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=514795714993271&preview=1)

When **Wrath of the Heavens** begins, position at the center of the arena to prepare for movement. Multiple enemies will appear:
- Two **Dragoons**
- A **White Dragon**
- Two large dragons (appear later)
- A **Warrior** and a **Mage** (spawned near the end)
{/* todo: Most likely will rewrite this section */}
> Treat the **Dragon** and the two **Dragoons** as **relative north** for this mechanic. The later will spawn at the intercardinals closest to it (northwest and northeast if White Dragon is North).

---

#### Initial Mechanics

As the phase begins, the following will happen:

1. **Tethers (Dragoon Dives)**  
   Each **Dragoon** will tether one player. These tethers will resolve as dashes when the dragons dive, dealing damage and applying **Magic Vulnerability Up** to the targets. Tethered players must dodge to avoid being hit directly.

2. **Skyward Leap (Defamation)**  
   One random player will be marked by **Skyward Leap**, a large blue AoE indicator (**Defamation**). This player must spread far from the group to avoid shared damage.

3. **Lightnings**  
   Two random players will be marked with a **Thunderstruck** debuff. When the debuff expires later, it will hit the player with a lightning puddle that stuns and damages anyone nearby.

4. **Twisters**  
   All players will be targeted with **Twisters**, invisible traps placed directly under their feet.

   > A **Twister** is a proximity-based AoE that triggers if stepped on or moved through. When triggered, it knocks back and kills nearby players.  
   > **Important**: Twisters snapshot when the **animation** begins—not when the cast bar ends. Movement must be precisely timed.

> All of the above—**Dragoons' tethers**, **Defamation**, and the **Twister dive**—will resolve **simultaneously** when the dragon dives across the middle of the arena.  
> The **Lightnings** are delayed and will resolve later, during the safe zone portion of the mechanic.

---

#### Pre-Dive Positioning and Dodge
{/* todo: Image pre dive */}
- **Unmarked players**: Spread to the **east side** of the Dragoons. Maintain spacing to avoid
  the **"Twisters"** that will drop beneath you.

- **Tethered players**: Stand **directly opposite** your tethered **Dragoon**, using arena lines or **4 notches from the intercardinal** on the wall for alignment.

- **Defamation**: Stand **4 notches northwest** (relative to the Twister Dragon) to safely isolate your AoE

Just before the dives resolve, two players will be marked with **Lightning Chains** (a buff that later explodes). These players should take note—they’ll need to spread out after the next mechanic.

When the dragons dive and tethers activate, dodge toward the middle to avoid **"Twisters"** or you will be killed. {/* todo specify following the lines on the floor, stay in your lanes */}
The tethered players and defamation player should move toward the west side of the arena in preparation for
the next mechanic. 

---

#### Divebombs & Proteans
{/* todo: Image post-twisters */}
Once the dragons dive and the tethers resolve, dodge toward the center to avoid the **Twisters**. While dodging, mainting your lines on the floor, treat them as lanes for yourself.

One player will be marked with a green circle **divebomb marker**. This marker disappears after a delay and shows where dragons outside the arena will dive.
{/* todo: custom debuff divebomb; explaining target will be charged by a dragon, Line AoE Damage and Knockback */}

- The divebomb marker player should move to the **wall behind the Mage**, opposite of the **Warrior** (south).
- At the same time, **Thordan** appears and casts a set of unavoidable **Protean AoEs** on the party.

> Overlapping these **Proteans** is lethal. Spread out approximately three to four tiles wide, while avoiding leftover Twisters.

- **Tethered and defamation players**: Move west.
- **Unmarked players**: Stay east (except for the divebomb marker, who stays south).

---

#### Targeted AoEs

Two players will now be targeted with AoEs based on whether or not they had earlier mechanics:

1. **Altar Flare**: Targets a player who previously had a Tether, Defamation, or Divebomb. Drops **4 delayed AoEs ("Eruptions")**.
2. **Liquid Heaven**: Targets a player who had **no previous mechanic**. Drops **5 fast AoEs**, one after another. Do not stagger these too much.

> These AoEs deal moderate damage. Both should be baited **away from the Warrior and the rest of the party**.
>  Make sure to bait puddles in a way that won't block off movement for anyone trying to get to the Warrior.

- After dropping their puddles, affected players should **loop back under the Warrior**.
- All other players should stay **south of the Warrior** to avoid Lightning AoEs. 

> If the Warrior spawns near you, be sure to bait the AoEs elsewhere—never drop them in the safe zone.

---

#### Warrior Safe Spot

After the Proteans and the divebomb marker disappears, the arena becomes dangerous except for the area under the **Warrior**.

> Treat the **Warrior’s position as relative north** for the rest of the mechanic.

The entire party should stack under the **Warrior**. Meanwhile:

- **Lightning-marked players** spread **north of the Warrior**, staying apart.
- Use the **inner ring** on the ground as a visual guide to avoid overlapping each other's AoEs.

> When the **Lightning Chain** expires, it will stun and damage anyone caught in the AoE.
{/* todo: Image safespot Warrior */}

---

#### Ancient Quaga 1

After all mechanics resolve successfully, **Thordan** will cast **"Ancient Quaga"** (as seen in Phase 2),
followed by one auto-attack and a double tank buster:

1. **"Heavenly Heel"**: Applies **Slashing Resistance Down**, making the target vulnerable to follow-up attacks.
2. **"Ascalon's Might"**: A powerful hit that must be invulned or tank-swapped due to the debuff applied.

Depending on your tank composition, these busters should be mitigated or invulned. Refer to the mitigation sheet for specific details.

Once the tank busters are finished, **Thordan** will begin casting **"Death of the Heavens"**, the second major mechanic of this phase.

---

### [Death of the Heavens (DotH)](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=414790163993271&preview=1#)

At the end of his cast, **Thordan** jumps away. **Grinnaux** (the Warrior) will spawn at a **random cardinal**, establishing your new **relative north** for the remainder of the mechanic.

Shortly after the **Warrior** spawns:
- **Four random players** will be inflicted with **Doom**, indicated by a red visual effect and party list debuff.
- The remaining **four non-doom players** will eventually drop **cleansing puddles**, which remove the Doom debuff when a doomed player is knocked into them.

Enemy placements are as follows:
- One **dragon** will appear at true north or south.
- Another **dragon** and a **knight** will appear near east or west **intercardinals**.
- These enemies will prepare massive **line AoEs**, carving out narrow safe zones.

---

#### Doom Mechanics

To prepare, the party should form a **conga line** facing the **Warrior**, evenly spaced:

{/* todo: Image */}

- **Non-doomed players** will drop the puddles used for cleansing.
- **Doomed players** will later be knocked into these puddles during chain resolution.

---

#### Safe Spot Positioning

The safe spots for the first part of this mechanic are as follows:

- **Two large safe zones** near the **East and West cardinals**
- **Two smaller safe spots** slightly **north or south of the intercardinals**

Position according to your **Doom status** and role:
{/* todo: Image Doom assignments */}
| Role               | Position                                              |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Outer Dooms**    | Inside the safe zone at **East or West**, on the **grey tile ring**  |
| **Inner Dooms**    | Slightly inside the **northern intercardinals**, one notch in from the edge |
| **Outer Non-Dooms**| At the **East or West walls**, aligned with the cardinal marker   |
| **Inner Non-Dooms**| Slightly inside the **southern intercardinals**, one notch in from the edge |

> Tip: Use the arena’s notches and tile markings to align precisely. Small missteps here can cause Twister or Lightning overlaps.

---

#### Mechanic Resolution

Following the Doom assignment:
- **Lightning Storm** targets all players with small AoEs that inflict **Lightning Resistance Down II**. Spread out—overlapping is lethal.
- **Twisters** are dropped beneath each player. These snapshot on animation and will kill nearby players if triggered.
- **Grinnaux** casts **Heavy Impact**, a large point-blank Earthquake AoE.

> **Twisters** resolve **when the dive happens**, not when the cast bar ends. Movement must be timed precisely to avoid triggering them.

> **Thordan** and **The Eye** will return from Phase 2. Note their positions outside the arena as they will cast a gaze attack.

To resolve this mechanic:
{/* todo: Image Earthquake dodge */}
1. **1st Heavy Impact (Earthquake)** goes off—**do not move yet**.
2. Immediately after, the following resolve **simultaneously**:
   - **2nd Heavy Impact (Earthquake)**, doom players move towards the Warrior.
   - **Divebombs** from dragons and the Dragoon knight
   - **Lightning Storm** and **Twisters**, non dooms move away from the Earthquake.
   - **Line AoEs** cleaving the arena
3. **3rd Heavy Impact (Earthquake)** goes off, non-dooms move into the next AoE.

> Move once lightning hits. It marks the safest time to dodge Twisters.

---

#### PlayStation Markers & Chains  
{/* TODO: Image - Doom marker positioning */}

Once everyone has regrouped in the center, the next sequence begins:  
a **knockback**, similar to Phase 1, layered with **chains** and **PlayStation markers**.

Every player must:
- **Break their chain** by reaching the wall
- **Resolve their PlayStation marker** safely
- **Cleanse Doom** by landing in a puddle if afflicted

**Doomed players** will receive:
- **Circle** – Always assigned to the **two furthest players**, baited intentionally by **outer Dooms** (typically East and West)
- **Square/Triangle** – Assigned to the **inner Dooms**, who must anchor **Southeast and Southwest** relative to the Warrior

> The rest of the party should remain closer to center to avoid accidentally baiting unwanted markers.

**Non-doomed players** will receive:
- **Cross** – will aways be **North and South**. These can be **pre-positioned** ahead of time
- **Square/Triangle** – should position opposite to their doomed partners who are already
  anchored in position

> Correct positioning ensures clean knockbacks, safe AoEs, and proper Doom cleanses.

As knockback resolves, **Thordan** and **The Eye** will appear outside the arena and cast a **gaze attack**.  
All players must **face away** during the knockback to avoid being stunned.

---

#### Knockback Resolution
{/* TODO: Image - Gaze + PlayStation markers + Knockback Positioning */}

As everyone prepares for knockback, **face away from Thordan and The Eye**, who will cast a gaze attack (same as Phase 2).  
Each player is knocked back to either a cardinal or intercardinal position based on their marker setup.

- **Doomed players** must land in the puddles dropped earlier to cleanse.
- **Everyone** must reach the wall to break their chains and avoid overlapping AoEs.

> Failure to reach your assigned position or cleanse Doom will result in deaths.

{/* TODO: Image - Limit Break 2 Meteor Targets*/}

After knockback resolves, **8 meteors** spawn around the edge of the arena.  
These meteors must be destroyed **before hitting the ground**, or the raid will wipe instantly.

- Use **Caster Limit Break 2** on 3 meteors—typically those around **True North** (A marker).
- If your caster is dead, a **Physical Ranged LB2** can substitute in an emergency.

Each player should focus on the meteor closest to where they were knocked back.  
Ignore the LB targets to ensure even damage distribution.

---

### Ancient Quaga 2

After all mechanics resolve successfully, **Thordan** will return to the arena and cast **Ancient Quaga**, a raid-wide AoE seen previously in Phase 2.

He will then follow up with:
1. **Heavenly Heel** – Applies **Slashing Resistance Down**, making the target vulnerable to follow-up attacks.  
2. **Ascalon’s Might** – A powerful multi-hit tankbuster that **must be invulned or tank-swapped** due to the resistance debuff.

This combo is followed by one final **auto-attack** before **Thordan** begins his enrage cast.

> Depending on your tank composition, this sequence should be **invulned**, **mitigated**, or **swapped**.  
> Refer to the **tank mitigation sheet** for specific assignments.

**Healers** should be ready for heavy tank damage during this window.

> **Important**: Do not kill Thordan.
> Reduce him to approximately **2% HP**, then stop DPS immediately.

If he is killed fully, the party will **wipe during Phase 7**.  
Sparing him causes him to jump away, allowing the encounter to continue.

---

## [P6: Nidhogg and Hraesvelgr](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=426762112878561&preview=1)

{/* todo: Images */}

This phase features a simultaneous fight against **Nidhogg** (West) and **Hraesvelgr** (East), who remain fixed in place with omnidirectional hitboxes. Each dragon has its own tank and must be handled carefully.

> Tanks must establish aggro quickly—both dragons will auto-attack and continue doing so throughout the phase.

---

### Phase Wide Mechanics

**Solemn Vow** – If any player is killed by **Hraesvelgr**, his **Solemn Vow** is broken. This grants him a permanent damage up and damage taken down buff, effectively a soft enrage. He will begin one-shotting anyone he hits.

**Wyrmsclaw** – High-damage auto-attacks used by both dragons. Tanks should be ready to mitigate and be topped between mechanics.

**HP Sync Requirement** – Both dragons must have their HP within **3% of each other** at specific moments (especially during **Akh Afah**). If the difference is too large, one stack becomes lethal and triggers a soft enrage (similar to TEA's Hand of Pain).

**Mortal Vow** – A debuff that will be passed between players throughout the fight. It reduces the
  affected player's healing output (not healing received) and explodes in an AoE when it expires. If
  another player is in this AoE, they receive the debuff. If not passed, **Nidhogg** will soft enrage
  similar to **Hraesvelgr**.

---

####  Mortal Vow

**Mortal Vow** is a debuff applied to a random DPS shortly after the phase begins. It must be **passed four times** throughout the phase.  
- When **Mortal Vow** expires, it deals AoE damage and attempts to pass to the nearest player.  
- If **no one is in range**, or if the player dies while holding it, **Nidhogg enrages**.  
- If **multiple players** are hit, only one receives the debuff. The others are afflicted with **Suppuration**, reducing their max HP by 50% and increasing damage taken.

> Mortal Vow applies a DoT and **reduces healing output**, making it dangerous for support jobs to hold.  
> The original carrier also gains **Mortal Atonement**, preventing them from receiving the debuff again.

**Standard passing order** (XTTMC):
- Random DPS → G1 Tank → G2 Tank → G1 Melee → Caster  
- If G1 Melee receives the first Vow, G2 Melee takes their spot later

---

#### Light Parties

Assign your light parties for the entire phase:

- **Group 1 (Left):** Focus **Nidhogg**
- **Group 2 (Right):** Focus **Hraesvelgr**

Keeping party splits consistent ensures clean **Akh Afah** stack resolutions and helps balance **damage output** between the two dragons.

---

### Wyrmsbreath 1

Shortly after the phase begins, both dragons will cast **Wyrmsbreath**, the first major mechanic.
{/* todo: Image */}
- The **outer arena** is covered by a donut AoE (**Swirling Blizzard** from Hraesvelgr).
- Both bosses tether to **three random non-tank players** each with elemental breath tethers:
  - **Nidhogg** → **Dread Wyrmsbreath** (Fire Breath)
  - **Hraesvelgr** → **Great Wyrmsbreath** (Ice Breath)
- Each tether resolves as a **conal AoE** that applies debuffs based on the element:
  - **Boiling** → becomes **Pyretic** (moves = damage)
  - **Freezing** → becomes **Deep Freeze** (immobilized)
- To avoid these effects, **each non-tank must be hit by both breath types**, canceling the elemental debuffs.

---

#### Tether Resolution

Tethers are **proximity-based** and must be stretched to avoid lethal damage. A colored indicator shows whether you're close (bad) or far (safe). Position carefully to bait opposite elements within your pair.

Players will form **three pairs** across the southern part of the arena:
- **Melees**: Near the **1 marker**, close to both dragons' breath angles
- **Group 1 Ranged/Healer**: Southwest
- **Group 2 Ranged/Healer**: Southeast

Within each pair:
- One player anchors in a known position
- The other adjusts (flexes) based on which dragon tethers them
{/* todo: Explain flexes better idk */}
> Positioning is tight. Use the donut telegraph and the **brick lines** across the center of the arena to help space your pair without overlapping others.

---

#### Tank Busters (Simultaneous)
{/* todo: Images */}
While the party handles tethers, each dragon will also cast a **tank buster**. There are two variants depending on whether one or both dragons’ mouths are glowing:

1. **Both mouths glowing** → **Dark Orb & Holy Orb** (Split Tankbusters)
   - Each tank is targeted with a small AoE
   - Tanks **must stack together** in the middle to soak both orbs
   - Standing alone results in massive **Sustained DoTs** that will kill you

2. **One mouth glowing** → **Staggering Breath**
   - The glowing-mouth dragon casts a **conal AoE** down the **center** (Dark or Holy Breath)
   - The other dragon casts a **circular buster** on its target
   - Both tanks move to the **northern corner** of their respective dragon’s side, staying inside the donut AoE but avoiding the center

> If done correctly, no one will clip with AoEs, and tanks won’t overlap.

---

#### Summary of Responsibilities

- **Tanks**: Mitigate autos, grab aggro, watch for glowing mouths, move appropriately
- **Non-tanks**: Stretch tethers, match with opposite element partner, avoid overlapping others
- **Everyone**: Watch for donut AoE boundaries and use the brick lines for alignment

---

#### Mortal Vow Assignment

Once **Wyrmsbreath 1** resolves, a random **DPS** will be afflicted with **Mortal Vow**—a debuff that must be passed later in the phase.

To prepare:
- **DPS** should **spread** to avoid accidentally splashing the Vow AoE.
- **Supports (healers/tank)** can group near the middle to prepare for healing and avoid **Mortal Vow**.

> Passing order typically follows: DPS → G1 Tank → G2 Tank → G1 Melee → Caster  
> (Swap to G2 Melee if G1 received the first Vow.)

---

### Akh Afah 1

Immediately after Mortal Vow is applied, both dragons begin casting **Akh Afah**—massive stack mechanics that must be handled in **light parties**.

- Each dragon will target one **healer** with a stack marker
- These hits deal **heavy magic damage** and inflict **Magic Vulnerability Up**
- If both groups overlap, the result is instant death

The dragons also tether to one another at the beginning of the cast if their HP difference exceeds 3%:
- **White tether** = **Hraesvelgr** has more HP
- **Purple tether** = **Nidhogg** has more HP

> If the tether **persists until the end of the cast**, the **higher-HP dragon’s stack** will become **lethal**, wiping the party.

- **Group 1**: North (Nidhogg side)
- **Group 2**: South (Hraesvelgr side)

> This split mirrors your damage assignment and keeps tethers and stacks clean.

---

### Hallowed Wings 1
{/* todo: Images */}
After **Akh Afah**, **Nidhogg** will fly to the **North or South**, on either the **East or West** side of the arena. From this position, he will prepare **Cauterize**, cleaving **half the arena** in a straight line.

Simultaneously, **Hraesvelgr** will cast **Hallowed Wings**:
- One of his wings will glow, indicating which **half of the arena** will be **covered by a lethal AoE**
- The **non-glowing side** is safe

Together, these mechanics leave only a **single quadrant of the arena safe**.

> The party should start **near the center** to react quickly.

---

#### Hallowed Plume: Tankbusters
{/* todo: Images */}
Hraesvelgr will also cast **Hallowed Plume**, a tankbuster targeting **two players** based on his **head position**:

- **Head up**: Targets the **two furthest** players → **Tanks go far**, **party stays close**
- **Head down**: Targets the **two closest** players → **Tanks stay close**, **party spreads far**

Each buster is a large circular AoE that **must be taken solo**.

Tanks should:
- Maintain distance between each other to avoid overlapping AoEs
- Avoid clipping the party
- Stay within their assigned dragon’s hitbox if possible
- Use mitigation

> The party should react based on the **head position**:  
> - Head up = **Tanks far**, **Party stays close**  
> - Head down = **Tanks close**, **Party spreads out**

---

#### Mortal Vow 1st Pass

After all cleaves and tankbusters resolve, the **first Mortal Vow pass** will occur.

- The **DPS with the debuff** should move to **center**
- The assigned **G1 tank** steps in to take the AoE and receive the Vow
- All other players must avoid the center to prevent **Suppuration**

> Passing requires precise positioning—only one player should be within the explosion radius.

---

###  Wroth Flames
{/* todo: Images */}
**Hraesvelgr** jumps to one of three positions: **Far West**, **Middle**, or **Far East**, and either **North or South**.  
He then casts **Cauterize**, cleaving the area in front of him.

- If he’s Far East/West: He cleaves **half the arena**
- If he’s Middle: He cleaves the **center third**, leaving safe zones along the **East and West walls**

At the same time, **three orbs** spawn in sequence and will **explode in a cross pattern** (Flame Burst):

1. Center
2. One corner
3. Opposite corner

Each orb explodes in a large **plus-shaped AoE** across the arena. Getting hit inflicts **moderate damage** and **Damage Down**.

---

#### Debuff Assignments
{/* todo: Images */}
Players will receive one of three debuffs:

- **4 players**: 🔴 **Spreading Flames** – Small AoE spread on expiration (lethal if overlapped)
- **2 players**: ⚪ **Entangled Flames** – 2-player stack required on expiration
- **2 players**: No debuff – Must **pair with a White** debuffed player for stack

All debuffs resolve after the final Flame Burst.

---

#### Akh Morn

While dodging AoEs, **Nidhogg** casts **Akh Morn** on a random player:
- Requires an **8-player stack**
- Hits **4 times**
- Leaves **persistent puddles** that apply a **Lethal Bleed** if stepped in

---

#### Strategy Summary
{/* todo: Images */}
1. **Start near a corner** of the safe zone (based on Hraesvelgr’s position and first orb)
2. **Dodge to center** after first Flame Burst
3. **Stack for Akh Morn** and move as a group after each hit:
   - Use a **“J-path”** to curve around puddles and finish on the third hit
4. **After the fourth hit**, **players spread** for their debuffs:
   - 🔴 Red (Spreading Flames) → Spread out toward **Nidhogg**
   - ⚪ White (Entangled Flames) + No Debuff pairs → Stack together **toward Hraesvelgr**

---

#### NA Marker Strat (Optional)
{/* todo: Images */}
NA Party Finder often uses Target Markers to assign spread positions:

- 🔴 Spreads = “Target to Attack” 1–4 (West to East)
- ⚪ White + No Debuff Pair 1 = “Target to Ignore”
- ⚪ White + No Debuff Pair 2 = “Target to Bind”

> The markers form a lineup from West to East:
> **Attack 1, 2, 3, 4**, then **Ignore**, then **Bind**

---

#### Mortal Vow – 2nd Pass 

After **Wroth Flames** and all debuffs resolve, the second **Mortal Vow** pass takes place.

- The **current holder** (G1 Tank) moves to center
- The **next recipient** (G2 Tank) steps in to take the pass
- All other players should stay away from center to avoid **Suppuration**

> Make sure no party members drift into center during this pass—losing a tank to Suppuration is nearly unrecoverable.

---

### Akh Afah 2

Once the second pass resolves, the dragons will cast another **Akh Afah**, identical in structure to the first.

- Each healer is targeted by a **stack marker**
- Players must group into **light parties** to split the damage
- The dragons’ HP must be kept within **3%** of each other

If they’re unbalanced:
- **Purple tether** = Nidhogg has more HP
- **White tether** = Hraesvelgr has more HP
{/* todo: Image tether */}
If the tether **persists** when the cast finishes, the **higher-HP dragon’s** stack becomes **lethal**, wiping the group.

---

#### Positioning Reminder:
- **Group 1**: North (Nidhogg)
- **Group 2**: South (Hraesvelgr)

> This is the **final HP check**—after this, HP balance no longer matters until the end of the phase.

---

### Hallowed Wings 2
{/* todo: Images */}
After **Akh Afah 2**, the dragons combine multiple AoEs in a coordinated attack:

- **Hraesvelgr** casts **Hallowed Wings** (one side of the arena becomes lethal)
- **Hraesvelgr** also casts **Hallowed Plume** (two-player tankbuster based on proximity)
- **Nidhogg** casts either **Hot Wing** or **Hot Tail**:
  - **Hot Wing**: Cleaves North & South → Safe zone is **center strip**
  - **Hot Tail**: Cleaves center → Safe zones are **North or South**

All of these resolve simultaneously, leaving **one safe quadrant**, based on:

1. Which **Hraesvelgr wing glows**
2. Whether his **head is raised or lowered**
3. Nidhogg’s **cast bar** (Hot Wing or Hot Tail)

---

#### Resolution Flow
{/* todo: Images */}
1. **Check Hraesvelgr’s glowing wing** → move to **non-glowing side**
2. **Check his head position**:
   - **Head up** = Tankbusters target **furthest** players → **Tanks far, party close**
   - **Head down** = Tankbusters target **closest** players → **Tanks close, party far**
3. **Check Nidhogg’s cast**:
   - **Hot Wing** → Move into **center line** → In
   - **Hot Tail** → Move toward **side lines** → Out

---

#### Tank Positioning 
{/* todo: Images */}
Both tanks must bait **Hallowed Plume** from within the **one remaining safe quadrant**, while adjusting to **head position** and **Hot Wing/Tail** restrictions:

- **Head Up (furthest)** → Tanks space out along the outer edges of the safe quadrant
- **Head Down (closest)** → Tanks stack closer to Hraesvelgr inside the safe zone

Avoid overlapping busters or party AoEs. The party should position **relative to the tanks** to maintain safe distance.

> There is no pre-defined “wall vs. center” rule—just adjust within the safe quadrant based on bait logic and avoid clipping anyone.

---

#### Mortal Vow – 3rd Pass

Once the quadrant-cleave resolves, it's time for the **third Mortal Vow pass**.

- The **current holder** (G2 Tank) moves to the **center**
- The **next recipient** (G1 Melee or G2 Melee, depending on order) steps in
- As always, all other players should stay clear of center to prevent Suppuration

> This pass occurs quickly after Hallowed Wings 2, so coordinate positions beforehand to avoid hesitation or overlap.

---

### Wyrmsbreath 2

Immediately after the pass, **Wyrmsbreath 2** begins—but unlike the first, players are **not** meant to cancel their debuffs.

- Each non-tank will be tethered to **either Nidhogg (fire)** or **Hraesvelgr (ice)**
- These tethers still require **stretching** to prevent lethal damage
- However, players **should only be hit by one element**
  - Getting hit by both elements will **cancel your debuff**
  - This is **not desired** for the next mechanic

> This version is often called **Static WB2** in Party Finder

---

#### Positioning Overview (Static WB2)

- Each player has a **preset position**, usually based on a visual layout (see below)
- Players spread around the arena to safely stretch their tethers and only be hit by **one breath**
- Tanks handle their busters as before:
  - **Both mouths glowing** → stack mid
  - **One mouth glowing** → tanks move to respective corners to avoid center cleave

![Wyrmsbreath 2 Positioning](/images/ultimates/dsr/static-wb2.png)

> Players must retain their **Fire or Ice debuff** for the next mechanic, so do not stack with an opposite element.

---

### Cauterize & Touchdown


After **Wyrmsbreath 2** resolves, each player will retain either a **Fire** or **Ice** debuff:

- **Boiling** → becomes **Pyretic** (any movement = damage)
- **Freezing** → becomes **Deep Freeze** (immobilized)

To remove these:
- Players must be hit by the **opposite dragon’s dive** (Cauterize)

---

#### 🐉 Dive Resolution

Both dragons will dive across the arena:

- **Nidhogg** and **Hraesvelgr** appear at the **North wall**
- Each charges through the arena with **Cauterize**, dealing **heavy damage**
- Being hit by the **correct element**:
  - **Cleanses your debuff**
  - Prevents DoT application (Burns/Frostbite)
- Being hit by the **same element** applies a **DoT** and can be lethal

> Players must go to the dragon of the **opposite element** from their tether earlier

---

#### Tank Role

Each dragon targets the **first player in line** with a **heavy tankbuster** on impact. This must be handled via:

- **Tank invulns** 
- **Heavy mitigation** + shields

> Healers must be alert: this buster applies a **strong DoT** on top of the dive damage. Losing a tank here will likely trigger **Hraesvelgr’s enrage** due to Solemn Vow.

---

#### Touchdown

Immediately after, both dragons land:

- **Nidhogg** → lands at **center**, dealing **proximity-based AoE**
- **Hraesvelgr** → lands from the **South wall**, also dealing AoE

Players should:
- **Group near the North wall** to minimize damage from both impacts
- Be fully healed and shielded before the landings

---

#### Mortal Vow – Final Pass

Immediately after Touchdown, the **fourth and final pass** of **Mortal Vow** occurs.

- The current **melee** moves to the wall to drop the explosion
- The final recipient (usually **caster**) steps in to receive it

> After this pass, the Vow mechanic is complete. No further passing is required.

---

### Revenge of the Horde

As a final check, both dragons begin casting **Revenge of the Horde**—a synchronized enrage cast.

- Both **Nidhogg** and **Hraesvelgr** must be defeated **before** the cast finishes
- Focus remaining DPS and potions to push damage
- Apply raid-wide mitigation and healing if necessary

> If Thordan was spared in Phase 5, you will proceed to **Phase 7**.  
> If he was killed, you loop back to Phase 4 but will not have the tools require to kill the Eyes.{/* todo: Explain better if we want idk, lore nerd */}

---

## Transition: Alternative End

Before Phase 7 begins, **Dragon-king Thordan** initiates a cinematic sequence with multiple heavy-hitting raidwides.

- Two large AoEs hit the party and apply **unavoidable Bleeds**.
- These Bleeds cannot be mitigated and require spot healing—**do not** use strong party mitigation like **TBN** or **Panhaima** here.

After the second Bleed resolves, Thordan casts **Alternative End**, a massive raid-wide that **must** be mitigated.

> Apply mitigation **immediately after** the second Bleed expires.
> Using mitigation too early will leave the party vulnerable during **Alternative End**.

When this sequence is survived, the arena will shift, and the final encounter with **Dragon-king Thordan** will begin.

---

## [Phase 7: Dragon-king Thordan](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=448767858029561&preview=1)

Phase 7 features a tight, rhythmic pattern of mechanics centered around three repeating "Edge" attacks:
- **Exaflare's Edge** (3x)
- **Akh Morn's Edge** (3x)
- **Gigaflare's Edge** (2x)

Each is followed by **two sets of auto attacks** via the **Trinity** mechanic, which target three players at once.

The phase ends with **Morn Afah’s Edge**, a hard enrage involving lethal tower soaks.

---

### Core Mechanics Overview

This phase features a repeated pattern of Edge mechanics:
1. **Exaflare’s Edge** (3 times)
2. **Akh Morn’s Edge** (3 times)
3. **Gigaflare’s Edge** (2 times)

Each Edge mechanic is paired with:
- An **In/Out check**, based on sword glow
- A follow-up of **two Trinity autos**

#### Sword Color In/Out Guide:
- **Blue Sword (Ice of Ascalon)** → **Donut AoE** → Stand **inside** his hitbox
- **Red Sword (Flames of Ascalon)** → **Point-blank AoE** → Stand **outside** his hitbox

> This always occurs **first**, before resolving the rest of the mechanic (Exaflare, Akh Morn, or Gigaflare).
> Tanks must **swap every set of mechanic** to avoid overlapping Light/Dark resistance debuffs.

---

#### Trinity Auto Attacks

After each major mechanic, **Thordan** targets three players:

- **Highest enmity tank** → Dark Resistance Down
- **Second enmity tank** → Light Resistance Down
- **Closest non-tank** → Light + Dark Resistance Down + Physical Vulnerability Up

Each auto is a small AoE. If a player with Physical Vulnerability Up is hit again, they will die.

---

#### Positioning

- **Main Tank**: Face boss north
- **Off Tank**: Thordan’s right hand
- **Baiter (non-tank)**: Directly under the boss
- **Rest of party**: Away from all three to avoid cleaves

---

#### Baiting Rotation

| After...           | 1st Auto        | 2nd Auto        |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Exaflare’s Edge    | Melee DPS 1      | Melee DPS 2      |
| Akh Morn’s Edge    | Ranged DPS 1     | Ranged DPS 2     |
| Gigaflare’s Edge   | Healer 1         | Healer 2         |

>  Tank swap after each set to reset resistance stacks. 

---

###  Exaflare’s Edge
{/* todo: Images */}
Thordan summons **three triple-directional Exaflare spawners** around him. Each fires **moving AoEs** in its direction after a short delay. Being hit is fatal.

Each Exaflare begins with a **sword glow**:

- 🔵 **Blue sword (Ice of Ascalon)** → Start **in** (donut AoE)
- 🔴 **Red sword (Flames of Ascalon)** → Start **out** (point-blank AoE) 

#### Strategy

1. **Start South**: Position at the edge of the **Southern Exaflare**
   - Use **Sprint** and visual cues like the **light pillar** or **arena markers** for the dodge.
2. **First dodge**: As soon as the cast finishes, **step into** the center of the South flare path
3. **Second dodge**: After the AoE near you explodes, move **further South** (between the two blue diamonds)
4. **Finish**: After all Exaflares resolve, move **slightly forward** to maintain uptime

> Tanks should break left/right to prep for auto attack bait positioning

---

#### Trinity

Following Exaflare’s Edge:
- First **Trinity auto** is baited by **Melee DPS 1**
- Second **Trinity auto** is baited by **Melee DPS 2**

> Tanks must swap after the second auto to reset vulnerability stacks. 

---

### Akh Morn’s Edge
{/* todo: Images */}
**Thordan spawns 3 towers**, always relative to his facing:
- 1 behind him (rear)
- 1 front-left
- 1 front-right

Like all Edge mechanics, Akh Morn begins with a **sword glow**:

- 🔵 **Blue sword (Ice)** = Donut AoE → Start **in**
- 🔴 **Red sword (Flame)** = Point-blank AoE → Start **out**

Each tower hits **multiple times** and must be soaked correctly or the party will wipe.

#### Strategy

**Tower hits increase with each repetition**:  
- 5 hits (first Akh Morn)  
- 6 hits (second)  
- 7 hits (third)
{/* todo: Images */}
**First Akh Morn (3/3/2 Method)**:
- **Tank**: Rear tower
- **Group 1**: Left tower
- **Group 2**: Right tower

**Later Akh Morns (6/1/1 Method)**:
- **One tank**: Invulns rear tower
- **Other tank**: Right Tower
- **Remaining 6 players**: Left Tower

> Do not leave your tower early—missing even one hit causes massive raidwide damage.

---

#### Trinity

After the towers resolve:
- First **Trinity auto** is baited by **Ranged DPS 1**
- Second **Trinity auto** is baited by **Ranged DPS 2**

> Tanks must swap after the second auto to reset vulnerability stacks. 

---

### Gigaflare’s Edge
{/* todo: Images */}
As always, this mechanic begins with a **sword glow**:

- 🔵 **Blue sword (Ice)** = Donut AoE → Move **in**
- 🔴 **Red sword (Flame)** = Point-blank AoE → Move **out**

---

#### Strategy

1. **Gigaflare marker 1** spawns  
   → At the same time, **Thordan’s sword begins glowing** (In/Out preview only)
   → Be opposite of it

2. **Gigaflare marker 2** spawns  
   → Use this to determine the **rotation direction** (clockwise or counterclockwise)

3. **Gigaflare marker 3** spawns  
   → All three positions are set — move **opposite the second** and prep for In/Out

4. **Gigaflare cast finishes**  
   → The **sword AoE** and **Gigaflare 1** explode **together**

5. **Gigaflare 2** explodes  
   → Rotate opposite its position

6. **Gigaflare 3** explodes  
   → Final movement

---

> This combo layers an **In/Out ** with **three rotating proximity blasts**. Stay calm and rotate steadily—there’s plenty of room as long as you don’t panic or cut diagonals.
> Melee can hover near max range to maintain uptime while rotating.

---

#### Trinity

Following Gigaflare’s Edge:
- First **Trinity auto** is baited by **Healer 1**
- Second **Trinity auto** is baited by **Healer 2**

> Tanks must swap after the second auto to reset vulnerability stacks. 

---

### Morn Afah’s Edge (Enrage)

The final mechanic of the fight is **Morn Afah’s Edge**, Thordan’s enrage.

- Three massive **yellow towers** spawn around the boss in sequence.
- Each tower **must be soaked** by one player. Failing to soak a tower results in **instant raid wipe**.
- However, **any player standing inside** a tower when it resolves will **die**.

Since the towers are lethal by design, this mechanic is about **sacrificing players in a specific order** to buy time to kill Thordan.

#### Strategy

To maximize DPS uptime:

- **First set of towers** → Soaked by both **Healers** and the **Main Tank**
- **Second set of towers** → Soaked by both **Ranged DPS** and the **Off Tank**
- **Third set of towers** → **No one soaks** (let them explode)

> This gives **Melee DPS** the maximum uptime window for LB3 and final damage pushes.

#### Final Push

- If **Limit Break 3** hasn't been used by this point, a **Melee DPS** should use it at the **start of "Morn Afah’s Edge"**.
- This ensures maximum value during the final burst window.

>  If Thordan isn’t killed before the third tower set finishes resolving, the fight will end in a **full-party wipe**.

Congratulations on completing Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)! yippi
