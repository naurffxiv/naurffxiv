# Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate) In-Depth Guide

![Thordan](/images/thumbnails/ultimate/Thordan.png)

Welcome to NAUR's in-depth guide for Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate).

This guide will cover each phase in detail and provide tips to help you clear and understand the fight.
All of the strategies featured in this guide follow NA PF Strats.
These strats are commonly referred to as APD or NAUR strats.

If you have any questions regarding this guide, please feel free to join our
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/naurffxiv) and ask them.
Any issues or concerns can also be reported on the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/naurffxiv/naurffxiv).

## Pre-Fight Notes

Before reading the guide, there are a couple things to note about the fight:

1. To unlock DSR, you will need to have cleared "**Asphodelos: The Fourth Circle (Savage)**" and then
   speak to the Wandering Minstrel in Old Sharlayan.

2. When entering the instance, all players should try to be equipped with Best in Slot (BiS) gear
   as well as the highest tier of food and tinctures available. BiS gear is not entirely required
   to clear the fight but it will make the fight easier and more manageable with mistakes.
   Feel free to refer to the
   [NAUR - Current FFXIV Ultimate BiS Sets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V5HIN_yUxc-PIQQDv8zKkQ9TQNZ3OxQc66AxKIC_KaQ)
   spreadsheet for some example sets.

3. To better utilize this guide, please refer to the resources found in the
   [DSR resource page](/ultimate/dsr). Many resources such as raidplans, mitigation plans,
   cheat sheets, and more can be found there.

4. It should also be noted that if a player fails a mechanic in this fight, they will often
   receive a "**Damage Down**".

   > The "**Damage Down**" debuff in DSR will reduce the damage dealt by the player by 50% for 3 minutes.
   > In most cases, it is recommended for players to die when they receive this debuff as the
   > "**Weakness**" debuff is shorter and reduces less damage. This is not always the case as some
   > mechanics will require you to stay alive to resolve them but good to keep in mind.

5. All phases and major mechanics follow the Raidplans and Toolboxes found in the
   [DSR resource page](/ultimate/dsr). These links are also attached to the respective phase or mechanic headings.
   If a heading is underlined with a hyperlink, it will take you to the respective toolbox or raidplan.

## [P1: Adelphel, Grinnaux and Charibert](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=802461081524561&preview=1#1)

Phase 1 features **Ser Adelphel** (Paladin), **Ser Grinnaux** (Warrior), and **Ser Charibert** (Black Mage).
Only **Ser Adelphel** and **Ser Grinnaux** are initially targetable.

Notes before pulling:

1. Decide tank assignments. Each tank typically handles their assigned boss's tank busters.
2. Plan tank mitigation for the bosses' auto attacks. Note that Grinnaux's autos hit harder than Adelphel's.
3. Be sure to interrupt Adelphel's "**Holiest Hallowing**" cast (occurs three times).

   > This cast must be interrupted or the bosses will be healed, making the phase impossible.

Order of interrupts is: Adelphel Tank > Phys. Ranged > Adelphel Tank.

Pull both bosses center and focus DPS on Adelphel. The phase begins with "**Holiest of Holy**",
a heavy-hitting raidwide. Afterward, **Ser Adelphel** spawns a tether on a random player,
consisting of two tank busters: "**Holy Shield Bash**" and "**Holy Bladedance**".

The tank who has aggro of him will take this tether north using invulnerability while the party
stacks south to avoid cleave damage. A few moments after the tether spawns, both **Ser Grinnaux**
and **Ser Charibert** will cast mechanics of their own as the tether resolves.

**Ser Grinnaux's** cast is "**Empty Dimension**". This is a donut AoE that originates from him.
The party will need to make sure to be close to him.

**Ser Charibert's** cast is "**Heavensblaze**". This is a small AoE that will target a random party member.
The more players that stand in the AoE, the less damage it will do so the party should be stacked.

### Hyperdimensional Slashes

After the tank buster and AoEs, **Ser Adelphel** jumps to the arena's side becoming immune to damage while
**Ser Grinnaux** dashes center for two sets of "**Hyperdimensional Slashes**".
Four random party members will be marked with orange markers above their player model while four
others will remain unmarked.

The markers signify party members that are being targeted for a "**Hyperdimensional Slash**".
These slashes fire a line AoE in the direction of the marked party members.
The line AoE will also drop a "**Portal**" at the end of the line AoE.

> If these "**Portals**" are too close to one another or if a party member gets too close to them,
> they will explode and deal damage to the party. This will also apply a "**Damage Down**" debuff
> to the players hit by the explosion.

The four marked party members will need to spread in a way to avoid clipping other party members
and place the "**Portals**" far enough away from each other. To avoid clipping the unmarked players,
the first set of slashes will be taken on the north side of the arena. If the party is using the markers
from the DSR resource page, they are placed precisely so you can stand in the middle of them to avoid
the other marked players.

> There is no priority for spread positions. Try to preposition to where you want to go to avoid confusion.

The party members who are not targeted for slashes will need to stack south on the tip of the middle
diamond to bait a conal, shared AoE from **Ser Grinnaux**. One party member who is not marked is randomly
chosen to be the target of the shared AoE.

Both the line AoEs and the shared AoE will go off at the same time. As both initial mechanics resolve,
the unmarked party members will now be marked and the marked players will no longer be marked.
The new marked players will need to spread on the south side of the arena just as the other players
did on the north side while the north side stacks to share the conal AoE.

> To make the south spreads a bit easier, you can slightly preposition to the marker you want to go to
> when sharing the previous stack.

### Ser Adelphel Dashes

After the second set of "**Hyperdimensional Slashes**", **Ser Adelphel** will jump to a random cardinal
direction starting the next mechanic.

The party should position opposite of **Ser Adelphel** and prepare for a knockback from **Ser Grinnaux**:
**Faith Unmoving**. The party should use KB prevention to avoid being knocked into the wall or the
**"Portals"**. **Ser Grinnaux** will also cast another "**Holiest of Holy**" raidwide as the knockback goes off.

After the knockback, **Ser Adelphel** will dash around the arena in an hourglass formation dropping
"**Bright Flare**" orbs as he dashes. These orbs will explode after a short time.
The first dash will always be to a cardinal direction left or right of him.

To avoid the exploding orbs and his dashes, the party will need to move in the direction where he
initially dashes to. While moving in that direction, the party should be aiming for the green,
triangle-shaped marking on the floor at one of the intercardinal directions.

> Be sure not to be too far out or too far in while moving. The "**Portals**" can still explode if
> someone is too close, or you can get hit by the dash and orbs from **Ser Adelphel**.

Once **Ser Adelphel** finishes his dashes, he will follow up with a tank buster on whoever has
aggro of him. This tank buster knocks anyone back into the wall of death who is near the tank
taking the tank buster. The tank with **Ser Adelphel** should move away from the party as the
last dashes go off to avoid sending anyone into the wall.

When the dashes and tank buster have resolved, **Ser Adelphel** will attempt to cast
"**Holiest Hallowing**" that should be interrupted by the tank with aggro. The other tank
can interrupt if the tank with aggro is unable to.

### PlayStation Markers and Chains

Take both bosses to the center of the room and prepare for the next mechanic.
Tanks will need to make sure that the bosses are centered as much as possible, especially **Ser Grinnaux**.

Every party member will be marked with a PlayStation marker above their head and be chained to
a party member with the same marker.

- **Tanks**: Can receive Blue "X" or Purple Square.
- **Healers**: Can receive a Blue "X" or Green Triangle.
- **DPS**: Can receive a Red Circle, Purple Square, or Green Triangle.

> The chains need to be broken before they expire or they will one-shot the players.
> Tanks can survive but receive damage down.

Before chains and markers are applied, the party should try to be as close to the center of the
arena as possible. The closer the party is to their partner when the chain is applied, the easier
it will be to break the chain.

A couple moments after the markers are applied, **Ser Grinnaux** will cast another "**Faith Unmoving**"
knockback. Shortly after the knockback, **Ser Charibert** will cast an AoE on each party member.

To resolve the mechanic, a couple steps must be followed:

1. Move to the middle of the arena and prepare to be chained and marked.

2. Move to assigned position once marked and prepare for knockback.

As stated above, only certain roles will get certain markers. Each marker has a predetermined position
that is role dependent:

Blue "X" Positions

- Tank - North
- Healer - South

Green Triangle Positions

- DPS - North West
- Healer - South East

Purple Square Positions

- Tank - North East
- DPS - South West

Red Circle Positions

- Red Circle DPS Furthest West - West
- Red Circle DPS Furthest East - East

These positions ensure that your partner will always be across from you during the knockback to break the chain.

3. Prepare for the knockback from **Ser Grinnaux**.

> If positioned correctly, the knockback will send you to the edge of the arena, breaking the chain.
> Make sure to not be far out and inline with **Ser Grinnaux**. If not properly positioned with him,
> you may get knocked back towards another player. It is common for tanks to not have him properly
> positioned so adjust as needed.

Warriors should note that Inner Release knockback prevention will prevent them from being knocked back
if the buff is active.

4. Adjust position to avoid the AoE from **Ser Charibert** and prepare for the next mechanic.

As players are knocked back, the spread AoE will go off on each party member. If positioned correctly,
the players should be in position to take their AoE. Make sure to be close to the wall and adjust away
from players to avoid overlapping.

Tanks should bring the bosses back to the center of the room after resolving the PlayStation Markers,
chains, and spreads.

The party will need to group up for heals and keep the bosses around the same HP. Another
"**Holiest Hallowing**" will be cast which needs to be interrupted by the Phys. Ranged.

> If the Phys. Ranged is unable to interrupt, the **Ser Grinnaux** tank can interrupt if they have not already.

After the interrupt, **Ser Adelphel** will cast another "**Holiest of Holy**" raidwide while
**Ser Grinnaux** will cast a "**Full Dimension**" or "**Empty Dimension**" AoE. This is the same mechanic
at the start of the phase but it can either be a donut or point-blank AoE. Full is out, Empty is in.
After the raidwide, yet another "**Holiest Hallowing**" will be cast which needs to be interrupted by the Tank.
A final "**Holiest of Holy**" will be cast after the interrupt.

Finally, the "**The Bull's Steel**" will be cast. This is an enrage cast that gives them invulnerability,
damage buffs, and fully heals them, making the phase impossible to clear. Both bosses need to be defeated
at the same time or the one who did not die with the other will cast a quick enrage.

### Planar Prison

Once both bosses are defeated, they jump to the west side of the arena along with **Ser Charibert**
to pull you into the center of a death wall. While in this "**Planar Prison**", all party members
will be chained to **Ser Grinnaux** and movement speed will be reduced.

"**Haurchefant**" will spawn outside the arena, blocking an incoming attack that will cause raid-wide
damage until he is killed. "**Haurchefant**" will also have a healing debuff called "**HP Recovery Down**",
preventing him from being healed.

Throughout this mechanic, **Ser Charibert** will be casting "**Pure of Heart**", which is the enrage cast.
To beat this enrage, you must get him below 30% before the cast is finished.

During this time, four sets of two conal AoEs will be triggered in succession, emanating from **Ser Charibert**.
These cones are baited and hit the two closest party members to him. Once a party member is hit, they will be
applied with a "**Light Resistance Down**" debuff and "**Skyblind**", a puddle debuff that will drop a puddle
under them once "**Skyblind**" expires.

To resolve this mechanic, two sets of party members need to bait the cones south, away from the party,
who should stack north of **Ser Charibert**. The bait order is: Healers > Melee > Ranged > Tanks

After a cone is baited, move to one side of the party to drop the puddle debuff. Healers and Ranged will
drop their puddles left of **Ser Charibert**, facing him. Melee and Tanks will drop their puddles right
of **Ser Charibert**, facing him. Tanks can alternatively drop the puddles where they took the bait as
they are the last ones.

Once all baits have been taken, the cast will finish, resulting in a raid-wide AoE. If **Ser Charibert**
reaches below 30%, you will continue on to the next phase. If not, the raid-wide will kill you, sending
you back to the start of the phase.

The arena will transition to Phase 2 and **King Thordan** will spawn. Make sure to tag and hit him.
Not doing so will send you back to Phase 1.

---

# P2: King Thordan

The start of Phase 2 acts as a "checkpoint" for any future wipes. Any wipe from now on will send you 
to the start of Phase 2 rather than Phase 1. Markers should also be replaced with the second set of 
markers found in the [DSR resource page](/ultimate/dsr).

For the remainder of the fight, light parties will be used for positioning. Positions are always 
light party based.

Tanks should refer to the [NAUR Mitigation Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YJX933Fe6MeNv06QVQfRUI3oJVfCvm4OqOyLCSjcAJk/edit?usp=sharing). 
Tank cooldowns are extremely important in this fight and need to be followed.

## Start of Phase 2

At the start of Phase 2, **King Thordan** begins with 3 heavy-hitting auto attacks that cleave the 
targeted tank.

> Note that throughout the fight, **King Thordan's** auto attacks always cleave.

After his auto attacks, **King Thordan** casts "**Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**" - a baited protean AoE 
that will kill anyone hit by it. Everyone except the MT should stack south of the boss to bait all 
proteans in the same direction. Once the cast finishes, the party and main tank dodge to the side to 
avoid the proteans before returning to original positions.

**King Thordan** follows with a tank buster, "**Ascalon's Might**". This hits 3 times and cleaves. 
After the TB, **King Thordan** begins casting "**Strength of the Ward**", the first major mechanic 
of Phase 2.

## Strength of the Ward

"**Strength of the Ward**" has multiple moving parts which is broken down into parts for easier 
understanding.

### Strength of the Ward: Part 1

Once Thordan finishes casting, he jumps and becomes untargetable.
The first part involves four simultaneous mechanics:

- Three Knights spawn at random cardinals/intercardinals and cast "**Spiral Thrust**". They then dash 
  across the arena, knocking anyone in their path into the wall of death.
- **King Thordan** targets everyone with "**Lightning Storm**" - a small AoE that kills players if 
  overlapped.
- **Ser Guerrique** (Warrior) spawns at a random position in the center and casts "**Heavy Impact**" - 
  an AoE that creates expanding rings.
- **King Thordan** prepares another "**Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**" as the party dodges the rings.

First, identify the safe spots from the knights' dashes. There are always 2 "pizza slices" that are 
safe and opposite each other. These are determined by the floor markers' color and will always be the 
same color if using standard markers.

Since one pizza slice can't fit everyone, the party must split into light parties:

- "**Light Party One**" goes to the side with number markers.
- "**Light Party Two**" goes to the side with letter markers.

Within these safe spots, spread to avoid "**Lightning Storm**" overlap:

- **Healers**: Align on the tri-force icon on the wall.
- **Tanks**: Position in front of healers using the blue line as a guide.
- **DPS**: Position 5 notches away from the healer. Melee to the healer's left (facing in); 
  Ranged/Caster to the healer's right (facing in).

After "**Lightning Storm**" resolves, the knights' "**Spiral Thrust**" and **Ser Guerrique's** 
"**Heavy Impact**" rings activate. For dodging the rings, see Borunks' YouTube video for visual guidance. 
It's quite hard to explain in text, but the goal is to avoid the expanding rings while staying in the 
safe spots. Step into the ring only once, staying in line with your group.

As you move in, note that two **Paladins** will spawn in the arena. Keep note of which direction they 
are facing as the side furthest from them is where **King Thordan** will appear for the next part of 
the mechanic.

**King Thordan** will appear in the center of the arena and still untargetable. He will cast another 
"**Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**" targeting everyone with protean AoEs. Move as a line without fanning 
out to avoid clipping others. Step left or right when the cast finishes to dodge.

### Strength of the Ward: Part 2

After "**Ascalon's Mercy Concealed**" resolves, **King Thordan** will jump to a random cardinal or 
intercardinal position outside the arena. He will appear on the side furthest from where the two 
**Paladins** are facing. **Thordan's** position should be considered "**Relative North**" for this 
part of the mechanic.

Multiple mechanics occur simultaneously:

- Three players will be marked with blue circles above their heads for "**Skyward Leap**" (large 
  defamation AoEs).
- One non-tank who is not targeted for "**Skyward Leap**" will be selected for a party stack, 
  "**The Dragon's Rage**".
- Two tank tethers will spawn from the **Paladins** (same as P1's "**Holy Shield Bash/Holy Bladedance**" 
  combo).
- Dark AoE puddles will appear, forcing players to the arena edges to resolve mechanics.
- Six towers will spawn that need to be soaked after "**Skyward Leap**" and "**The Dragon's Rage**".

Tanks should grab their designated tether. Facing **King Thordan**, Main Tank takes the right tether, 
Off Tank takes the left. These tethers deal less damage when stretched farther, so cross them and 
bring them toward **King Thordan**. Tanks should end up to Thordan's left and right, facing the 
tethers outward away from the group.

"**Skyward Leap**" marked players must immediately move to designated safe spots at the new south, 
east, and west sides of the arena (treating **King Thordan** as **Relative North**).

There's no priority for these spots - go to the closest one while being aware of other marked players. 
To avoid grabbing tank tethers, take the long route around the **Paladins** rather than cutting 
between them. Do not move into the tanks' path to **King Thordan**.

Position precisely to avoid hitting others:

- South marker: Stand at the edge of the wall in line with the tri-force.
- East and west markers: Stand 2-3 notches away from **Relative North** (where Thordan is).

Non-tanks without "**Skyward Leap**" markers stack near **King Thordan** at the wall to share 
"**The Dragon's Rage**". They should also preposition on the wall (left/right/middle) to indicate 
which tower they'll take.

After all these mechanics resolve, six towers will spawn. Tanks will be down and unable to soak towers. 
All non-tanks will take their assigned/claimed tower.

Once towers are soaked, **King Thordan** casts "**Ancient Quaga**", a heavy-hitting raidwide that ends 
Strength of the Ward.

Before the next major mechanic, **King Thordan** performs two tank busters:
First, "**Heavenly Heel**", a heavy-hitting tankbuster that inflicts the main tank with 
"**Slashing Resistance Down**". This is immediately followed up by "**Ascalon's Might**", which will 
kill the tank unless swapped or an invulnerability skill is used.

After the tank busters, **King Thordan** will cast "**Sanctity of the Ward**", the next major mechanic.

## Sanctity of the Ward

### Sanctity of the Ward: Part 1

For this section, light parties and role-based partners from the opposite light party will be needed:

Partners: Tank-Tank | Healer-Healer | Melee-Melee | Phys. Ranged-Caster

Key mechanics occurring simultaneously:

1. **Paladins** spawn east and west, with a **Dark Knight** at a random intercardinal.

2. Two players receive markers: "one sword" or "two swords crossed", indicating who the **Dark Knight** 
   will target with "**Sacred Sever**". (Shared proximity damage that hits a total of four times, with 
   each marked player being hit twice for a total of 4 hits. The further you are from the source, the 
   less damage you will take).

3. The **Paladins** dash around the arena dropping explosive "**Brightorbs**".

4. **King Thordan** and "**The Eye**" cast gaze mechanics from outside the arena that inflict 
   "**Damage Down**" and "**Hysteria**" on players if looked at. Hysteria causes your character to 
   move uncontrollably in random directions. Looking at the eye also deals damage.

First, check for sword markers above players' heads:

- Marker 1 (one sword): Go to the wall directly across from the **Dark Knight** (plunged first)
- Marker 2 (crossed swords): Go to the wall directly behind the **Dark Knight** (plunged second)

If unmarked, check if your partner has a marker. Change groups only if you get an opposite number 
from your initial light party or your partner receives your group's number.

Group positioning:

- Group 1: Position on the wall directly across from the **Dark Knight**
- Group 2: Position on the wall directly behind the **Dark Knight**

When prepositioning, note which way the **Paladins** are facing (clockwise or counterclockwise). 
This determines your rotation direction for dodges. Preposition approximately 3-4 notches from the 
fidget spinner on the wall. This initial positioning is crucial.

As mechanics begin, dodge the **Paladins** dashes by moving four notches in your rotation direction 
to the first safe spot. Stay stacked for "**Sacred Sever**" damage sharing.

After the "**Brightorb**" in front of your party explodes, move into that space and continue 4-5 
notches in the same direction (ending about 3 notches from the next tri-force). Remain stacked as 
the **Dark Knight** completes its plunges.

When the plunges and dashes finish, prepare for the second part of the mechanic.

### Sanctity of the Ward: Part 2

For this part, split into pairs at each cardinal:

- Tank and Ranged: North and South (Group 1 North, Group 2 South)
- Healers and Melee: East and West (Group 1 West, Group 2 East)

Two players of the same role (Support or DPS) will get marked with "**Prey**".
These players will periodically drop 7 "**Meteors**" that cause minor raidwide damage.

"**Prey**" players will always occupy the North and South starting positions.
If marked, move clockwise to North or South unless already in a North or South position.
If someone occupies your rotation spot, continue clockwise to either North or South.

Each cardinal position forms a Support+DPS pair. These stacks will drop ice puddles when the 
mechanic resolves. The ice puddles need to be shared by the pair - a player taking an ice puddle 
solo will die. Fire puddles will appear on intercardinals. Standing in either puddle type causes 
a deadly bleed.

As the phase continues, each pair should use body language to indicate which tower they intend to 
take. This is especially important for East/West pairs, as they have more flexibility in tower 
assignments. Players typically walk in the direction of their intended tower to communicate this.

Eight towers will spawn in the arena. Each quadrant will always have at least one outer tower 
(at the wall). Each tower needs one player to absorb it.

Cardinal pairs are responsible for the towers in their quadrant, with these rules:

- Meteor role takes priority on outer wall towers and will always go out.
- If 2 wall towers are in your quadrant, both partners take the outside towers. Meteor role has 
  priority on cardinal towers. If there is no cardinal tower, the meteor role takes the most 
  clockwise tower.
- For inner towers, only one or no players from a pair go in; inner players take the closest tower 
  clockwise. If no tower is initially clockwise, continue clockwise until finding an empty tower.

North/South meteor players should aim to be 180 degrees apart when possible, following this priority:
1. North/South (ideal)
2. 180 degrees in some other configuration (e.g., NE/SW)
3. Slightly cursed (e.g., North + SW)
4. Cursed (same sub-direction, e.g., NE/SE)

This body language is particularly critical in the "double outer tower" pattern where there are 4 
towers at NE/NW and SE/SW positions.

After tower absorption, marked players must **immediately** begin moving clockwise around the arena 
to drop meteors. Any delay will cause the meteors to spawn too close together and explode. The path 
taken depends on the pattern:

- 180-degree pattern: Simply move from N→S or S→N
- Slightly cursed pattern: The player with less than 180 degrees should take the longest possible 
  route, moving around the fire/ice puddles
- Cursed pattern: Requires specialized movement techniques (refer to video examples)

During meteor drops, another set of 8 towers spawns along the wall at cardinals and intercardinals. 
Meteor roles take cardinal towers; non-meteor roles take intercardinal towers.

**Ser Grinnaux** will appear and begin casting "**Faith Unmoving**", which triggers a knockback.

- Outside players: **must** activate knockback immunity when **Ser Hermenost's** Conviction cast 
  reaches the "C" in the castbar, or after the 5th meteor drops.
- Inside players: can ride the knockback into their tower's position.

Once all towers are soaked, **Sanctity** ends. **Thordan** will appear to the north and cast 
"**Ultimate End**", a heavy-hitting raidwide. After this, he receives the "**Discomposed**" debuff, 
increasing his damage taken by 30%.

He will then cast two sets of "**Broad Swings**", each consisting of three slashes (similar to a 
mini-trine or 3-1 dodge mechanic). Each set can be random, but the pattern always starts with either 
**Left** or **Right** and finishes with **Back**. To dodge these:

1. Start behind **Thordan**.
2. Move into the safe spot for the first swing (the area he is not swinging at).
3. Wait until Thordan repositions and then readjust for the next swing.

Finally, **Thordan** begins his enrage cast "**Aetheric Burst**" and must be killed before it completes.

---

## [P3: Nidhogg](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=267799249146271&preview=1#)

Once **Thordan** is defeated, the arena transitions into Phase 3, starting with a massive raid-wide AoE,
**"Final Chorus"**, from **Nidhogg** as he descends.

He will begin auto-attacking the main tank three times with cleaving line AoEs.
The tank should face the boss north at the A marker. **Nidhogg** will then cast
**"Dive from Grace"** aka _Wyrmhole_.

As **Nidhogg** finishes casts, each player is assigned a **numbered debuff** (1-3) determining the order
in which **Nidhogg's clone** will target them for a dive attack. Players are divided into:

- Three **"First in Line"** (I) debuffs
- Two **"Second in Line"** (II) debuffs
- Three **"Third in Line"** (III) debuffs

Each dive will spawn a tower 3 seconds after hitting the player, which must be soaked by another player.
A **Nidstinien clone** will appear at the tower's location, locking onto the closest player.
The soaker must face the clone away from the party to avoid cleaving others.

### Tower Placement & Arrows

Before the dives resolve, some players will receive an arrow debuff or no debuff, affecting where their
tower will spawn.

- **Up arrow** (**"Spineshatter Dive Target"**) → Tower spawns **in front** of the player.
- **Down arrow** (**"Elusive Jump Target"**) → Tower spawns **behind** the player.
- **No arrow** (**"High Jump Target"**) → Tower spawns **directly on** the player.

To simplify, follow the **Westhogg strategy**:

- **Arrow debuff** → Always face **west** before getting hit, ensuring towers spawn in predictable spots.

### Pre-Positioning

Before the mechanic resolves, players should claim spots:

- **(I)** players take the east/south/west spots.
- **(II)** players take the north-west/north-east spots.
- **(III)** players take the east/south/west spots.

Players assigned arrows should follow the following positioning: **down arrows** always take **west**,
**up arrows** take **east**, and **no arrows** take the **south** spot.

The dive and tower soak pattern follows a set order:

1. First set: (I) get hit, (III) soak towers.
2. Second set: (II) get hit, (I) east/west soak towers.
3. Third set: (III) get hit, (II) soak towers, and (I) soaks the south tower.

After the debuffs are applied, **Nidhogg** will begin casting **"Gnash and Lash"** or **"Lash and Gnash"**,
determining the in/out AoE pattern for the upcoming mechanic.

- "**Gnash**" = Out
- "**Lash**" = In

He will cast this mechanic twice during the phase. The pattern is not guaranteed to be reversed,
so players need to track the order for later mechanics. The first cast will happen during the
**First** (I) and **Third** (III) tower placements.

### Wyrmhole

#### First Stack

The party should stack on the boss's hitbox to soak the **"Eye of the Tyrant"**, which deals heavy
stack damage. Meanwhile, **(I)** players should position themselves at the edge of the hitbox to
prepare for tower placements.

> **Important**: Be mindful of **"Gnash and Lash"** timing, as it has a delayed execution after the cast bar.
> Always watch for the visual cue of **Nidhogg's** wings to know when to move.

Once a group is hit by the clones, they will lose their debuff and gain **"Fire Vulnerability"**,
preventing them from soaking the next set of towers.

As the **(III)** group moves into position to soak the towers that **(I)** previously placed,
**Nidhogg** will cast the second portion of **"Gnash and Lash"** again, with the order of the
attacks reversed.

After the towers are soaked, **Nidhogg's clones** will spawn at the soaked locations. They will
lock onto the closest player, and players must bait the clones' line AoEs towards the wall. Be sure
to dodge the second part of **"Gnash and Lash"** before the clones resolve.

While **(III)** are baiting the line AoEs, **(II)** should place their towers at max melee range
to the northeast and northwest, following their assigned arrows. At this point, **(III)** should
be preparing to drop their towers.

Once **(II)** has placed their towers, **(I)** who soaked the east and west towers should move to
soak the second set of east and west towers. After soaking, bait the clones outside towards the wall.
After baiting clones, **(I)** should swiftly move for the next stack.

#### Second Stack

A total of 5 players—the **2 (I) players** who soaked the northeast and northwest towers, the
**south (I)** who hasn't soaked a tower yet, and the **2 (II) players** who placed their towers—should
stack north on the boss's hitbox to take the second **"Eye of the Tyrant"**. **Nidhogg** will then
cast **"Gnash and Lash"** again.

After dodging the second part of **"Gnash and Lash"**, the **(II)** and **(I)** players who have not
yet soaked a tower will move to handle the **(III)** dropped towers and bait the Nidhogg clones one
last time. Meanwhile, the party should focus on resolving both parts of **"Gnash and Lash"** accordingly.

---

### Drachenlance

After all the clones are baited, the main tank must move away from the party to avoid cleaving auto-attacks.
The tank can either stand in front of where they last took their tower or move to an intercardinal position.

Two cleaving tank AA attacks will follow. Afterward, **Nidhogg** will face a random player and cast
**"Drachenlance"**, a 90-degree frontal cleave. Simply move away from the cleave before the cast ends.

#### Darkdragon Dive (Enums)

Once **Drachenlance** is done, move with your meteor partner to the clockwise intercardinal from your
meteor position to prepare for tower soaks. One tower will spawn at each intercardinal, requiring 1-4
players to soak.

#### Enumeration

All eight players must be assigned to soak a tower. If a tank or melee's default tower requires only one player,
they must adjust by checking **clockwise**, then **counterclockwise**, and finally diagonally for a tower
that requires 3 or 4 soakers.

Three of the towers will spawn **Nidhogg clones**, which will lock onto the nearest player.
Ranged players should position themselves at the center of the tower to ensure the clones face them
and point them outward to avoid overlap. The clones will cast a line AoE, so after baiting them,
the party should collapse onto the **east** and **west** markers to prevent cleaving and create space
for **"Soul Tether"**.

### Soul Tether

One tower and the boss will **"Soul Tether"** to random players. Tanks should follow the
[mitigation sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YJX933Fe6MeNv06QVQfRUI3oJVfCvm4OqOyLCSjcAJk/edit?usp=sharing)
to handle this mechanic. If tethered to a tower, collapse east or west to ensure the tank can easily grab the tether.

> Tethers are the hardest hit in all of DSR and require comprehensive mitigation from tanks, as well as
> external cooldowns from healers. Tanks may also invuln the tethers to reduce the damage.

Tanks can safely resolve tethers in the following positions:

1. Under the boss (invuln if stacking together),
2. Under the tower that extended the tether (the size of the AoE is exactly the size of the base of the tower),
3. Directly north or south.

Once the clones and **"Soul Tether"** are dealt with, cleaving auto-attacks will resume, followed by one
final **"Drachenlance"**. If **Nidhogg** reaches 8% HP or lower before enrage, players should clear the
phase and move on to Phase 4.

---

## [P4: The Eyes](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=613699253336171&preview=1#)

The arena will transition to Phase 4 after **Nidhogg** is defeated. This part of the guide follows the
[DSR Phase 4 - Eyes Toolbox]().

At the start of this phase, everyone should stack on the **1 marker** to receive buffs from **Alphinaud**
and someone who will be randomly targeted for **"Soul of Friendship"**. These buffs will be required to
do damage during this phase.

Throughout this phase, players will be fighting the **Eyes of Nidhogg** that appear on the west and east
sides of the arena:
- **Blue Eye**: Always positioned west
- **Red Eye**: Always positioned east

### Initial Positioning

DPS should initially attack the **Blue Eye** while supports focus on the **Red Eye**. Tanks need to
establish aggro on both eyes as they perform auto-attacks throughout the phase. Ensure at least one
tank secures aggro on the **Blue Eye**.

Shortly after receiving the buffs, **"Resentment"** will be cast, which is a raidwide AoE that applies
a bleed effect.

### Hatebound

Once the bleed effect expires, **"Hatebound"** will be cast. This mechanic tethers 4 players with blue
tethers and 4 players with red tethers. These tethers can be passed by standing on another player,
similar to mechanics like Rot, Nisi, or the role call debuff in P4S.

Ideal tether assignments:
- **Melee and Tanks**: Should have Red tethers
- **Ranged and Healers**: Should have Blue tethers

> If you have the wrong color tether, stack on **Estinien** in the middle of the arena to pass it.

Once you have the correct tether, move to your predetermined position:

- **Melee/Tanks**: Position in front of YELLOW orbs
  - DPS west, Supports east
- **Ranged/Healers**: Position in front of BLUE orbs
  - DPS west, Supports east
- **Group 1**: North side
- **Group 2**: South side

### Blue and Yellow Orbs

As orbs grow for the first time, melee and tanks will pop their yellow orbs. After popping, they will
pass their tethers to the ranged and healers:
- **Group 1**: Pass tethers on the north side
- **Group 2**: Pass tethers on the south side

Once the tethers are swapped, melee and tanks can move to the **Blue Eye**, being careful to stay away
from the orbs on the north and south.

As the blue orbs grow again, Ranged and Healers will pop their orbs, then move west to the **Blue Eye**.
These players, that have red tethers, will form a box formation standing max melee at the intercardinals of it.
Healers on the east side, Ranged on the west side. The tanks and melee DPS that have blue tethers stack directly on the eye.

For the next mechanic, you should aim to have the **Red Eye** at approximately 40% HP, as the upcoming mechanic
will deal 40% of its HP in damage.

### Mirage Dives

As the phase progresses, players with the red tether will begin receiving **"Mirage Dives**".
There will be 3 sets of 2 dives each:
- 2 Players with the Red debuff will be targeted with small-AoE dives
- 2 Players with the Blue debuff must approach the dive-targeted players and swap debuffs/positions with them

> **Note**: The **Red Eye** takes damage each time a player with a red debuff (those targeted by dives)
> takes damage. The tether passes can be finicky, so the person who just took the dive should wait until
> the tether is passed before moving to the middle.

Swap order: Tanks → Melee → First divers

To determine who to swap with, we use a "snake" priority system based on your light party:
- **Group 1 Swaps**: Northwest, moving counterclockwise
- **Group 2 Swaps**: Northeast, moving clockwise

After the 3rd dive, those who were hit by the first dive must go back out and swap with those who were
just hit. Priorities are as follows:
- Counterclockwise most 1st dive: Northwest, moving counterclockwise
- Clockwise most 1st dive: Northeast, moving clockwise

After the 4th dive, players may move freely.

### Enrage

Both Eyes will begin casting a raidwide AoE **"Steep In Rage"**. Healers should ensure all DPS are at
full HP. At least one eye must die before this cast completes, or the damage will be lethal without
heavy mitigation.

> **Note**: With current DPS levels, it's possible for both eyes to die before this cast finishes.

If both eyes are defeated before **"Nidhogg's Influence**" reaches 100, you will see a cutscene transitioning
back to the first phase, leading into the Rewind mechanic.

## Intermission: Rewind

This mini-phase operates much like the **Planar Prison** encounter in Phase 1, but with one critical difference:
you must save **Haurchefant**.

To save **Haurchefant**, the party must utilize **Tank Limit Break 3**. One of the tanks have to execute the
Limit Break as soon as **Haurchefant** appears, approximately 3 GCDs into the phase.

> **Important**: Healers will need to spot heal both **Haurchefant** AND the party, as the missile
> attacking him will continue to deal damage throughout the entire phase.

If the party or **Haurchefant** is not healed sufficiently when **"Pure of Heart"** finishes casting,
both **Haurchefant** and the party will most likely die. If **Haurchefant** dies, you will be sent
back to Phase 1.

Additionally, the spear will become targetable and must be defeated before it kills **Haurchefant**.
Focus all damage on the spear while maintaining healing on both the party and **Haurchefant**.

If executed correctly, you will successfully save **Haurchefant** and proceed to Phase 5.

---

## P5: King Thordan II

Phase 5 begins with **Thordan** returning from Phase 2, now in a corrupted form. **Thordan** will spawn
facing south and immediately perform 2 cleaving auto attacks.

> The tank should keep the boss facing south, being careful not to aim cleaves toward the party.

After these auto attacks, **Thordan** will cast **"Wrath of the Heavens"**, initiating the first major
mechanic of Phase 5.

### [Wrath of the Heavens (Wrath)](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=514795714993271&preview=1)

When **"Wrath of the Heavens"** begins, position in the middle to prepare for quick movement. The arena
will be filled with several enemies:
- Two **Dragoons**
- A **White Twister Dragon**
- Two larger dragons

> The **Twister Dragon** and the two **Dragoons** at its intercardinals will be relative north for this mechanic.

#### Initial Mechanics

Several mechanics occur simultaneously:

1. Two players will be tethered to the **Dragoons**. These players will be targeted for dashes and will
   receive a magic vulnerability debuff when hit.

2. One player will be selected for **"Defamation"** (large, blue, AoE marker), operating the same way as in Phase 2.
   This player must spread away from the rest of the party.

3. Everyone will receive a **"Twister"** beneath them when the mechanic activates.

   > **Important**: If **"Twisters"** are stepped on or stood in, they will trigger a knockback AoE that
   > will kill everyone in close proximity.

4. A **Warrior** and a **Mage** will spawn at north and south positions, opposite each other. Note their
   positioning as it will be important for the next part of the mechanic.

#### Positioning

- **Unmarked players**: Spread along the wall to east of the **Dragoons**. Maintain spacing to avoid
  the **"Twisters"** that will drop beneath you.

- **Tethered players**: Position directly opposite of your tethered **Dragoon**. You can align your character
  and the **Dragoon** using the lines in the arena or use the notches on the arena wall (4 notches from
  the intercardinal).

- **Blue marked player** (Defamation): Position four notches from the new northwest.

When the dragons dive and tethers activate, move toward the middle to avoid **"Twisters"** or you will be killed.
The tethered players and defamation player should move toward the west side of the arena in preparation for
the next mechanic.

> **Note for UCOB players**: The **"Twister"** does not snapshot when the cast bar for **"Twisting Dive"**
> completes, but instead snapshots when the animation plays.

Just before the mechanic resolves, two players will be marked with lightning. These players should note this
for the upcoming mechanics.

#### Divebomb and Proteans

After dodging the **"Twisters"**, one player will be marked with a green circle divebomb marker. This marker
will disappear after a few seconds, indicating where the dragons outside the arena will dive next.

The player with the divebomb marker should go to the wall behind the **Mage** (opposite from the **Warrior**).
At the same time, **Thordan** will appear and hit everyone with unavoidable protean attacks. Overlapping
these proteans will kill both players.

Everyone should spread out again, careful not to step in the **"Twisters"**:
- Tethered players and defamation player: Position west
- Unmarked players: Remain east (except for the divebomb player who stays south)

#### Warrior Safe Spot

After the proteans and when the divebomb marker disappears, the entire arena except for the area around
the **Warrior** will become unsafe. The party must move under the **Warrior**, treating it as the new
true north.

Lightning-marked players should position on the north side of the **Warrior**, spreading away from each
other. The large inner ring can serve as a positioning guide. When the lightning buff expires, it hits
the player with a lightning AoE that stuns anyone caught within it.

#### Targeted AoEs

Two types of targeted AoEs will occur:

1. **Eruptions**: One player who previously had a tether, defamation, or divebomb will be targeted with
   4 **"Eruptions"** - large AoE puddles that drop after a delay. These must be placed away from the
   **Warrior** and the party.

2. **Liquid Heaven**: One player with no previous mechanic will be targeted with **"Liquid Heaven"** -
   similar to **"Eruptions"** but dropping more quickly and with 5 puddles total. These also need to
   be placed away from the **Warrior** and party.

Players targeted with these AoEs should move away from the **Warrior**, avoiding party members, and then
loop back to the **Warrior** for safety.

> If the **Warrior** spawns near you, move away to avoid dropping AoEs in the safe spot.

All other players should stand south of the **Warrior** to avoid the lightning AoEs.

### Transition to Death of the Heavens

After all mechanics resolve successfully, **Thordan** will cast **"Ancient Quaga"** (as seen in Phase 2),
followed by one auto-attack and a double tank buster:

1. **"Heavenly Heel"**: Applies a slashing resistance down debuff
2. **"Ascalon's Might"**: Follow-up buster that can be fatal without proper mitigation

Depending on your tank composition, these busters should be mitigated or invulned. Refer to the mitigation
sheet for specific details.

Once the tank busters are finished, **Thordan** will begin casting **"Death of the Heavens"**, the second
major mechanic of this phase.

### [Death of the Heavens (DotH)](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=414790163993271&preview=1#)

After finishing his cast, **Thordan** will jump away and the **Warrior** will spawn again at a random cardinal.
This position becomes your new true north. **Dragons** and a **Dragoon** will also appear outside the
arena in static positions, cleaving the arena and leaving only small safe zones in the East, West, and
even smaller spots at intercardinals.

> These dives and dashes will always follow the same pattern, so you can maintain orientation by
> treating the **Warrior** as true north.

#### Doom Mechanics

Shortly after the **Warrior** spawns, 4 players will be marked with **"Doom"**. This appears as a red
visual effect and a debuff on the party list. In Party Finder, players typically identify this by looking
for the red visual effect on nearby players.

To prepare for this mechanic, the party will line up in a "conga line" facing the **Warrior**. For NA
strats, the positions aren't always static, but typically follow a **H-R-M-T-T-M-R-H** formation. Players
without **"Doom"** will drop a puddle that can cleanse the **"Doom"** debuff from affected players.

Additionally, each player will be hit with lightning and drop another **"Twister"** just like in
**"Wrath of the Heavens"**, requiring everyone to spread out among the safe areas. The **Warrior** will
also perform earthquake attacks similar to those seen in Phase 2.

#### Safe Spot Positioning

The safe spots for the first part of this mechanic are as follows:

- **Outer Dooms**: Position at the inner sides of East and West on the darker tile ring
- **Outer Non-Dooms**: Position at the wall of East and West
- **Inner Dooms**: Position at the northern intercardinals above the marker
- **Inner Non-Dooms**: Position at the southern intercardinals just below the marker

> Positioning details:
> - North and South positions: Stand one notch toward the inside of the arena
> - Inner Dooms: Stand on the larger inner ring in line with the cardinal markers
> - Outer Dooms: Stand along the wall in line with the cardinal markers

#### Mechanic Execution

Shortly after **"Doom"** debuffs are applied, the mechanics will begin resolving. First, the **Warrior**
will perform an initial point-blank earthquake. Do not move yet.

Just after the initial earthquake, dives, lightning, and twisters will all activate simultaneously.
This is when you should begin dodging the earthquake and twisters.

> A good timing indicator is to move when the lightning hits. Move immediately to avoid being caught
> in the expanding earthquake rings.

#### PlayStation Markers and Chains

Once everyone has dodged to the center, prepare for the next part of the mechanic: a knockback similar
to Phase 1. All players will be paired with chains and PlayStation markers and must break these while
also cleansing **"Doom"** debuffs.

One key difference in this version:
- **Circle markers** can be baited to the 2 players furthest from the middle
- The party should position closer to the center to avoid taking the Circle bait
- **Dooms** who were East and West should position outward to bait these markers

The other **Doom** players will receive either Square or Triangle markers. These players will anchor
the Southeast and Southwest positions. All 4 **Doom** players must be in these positions to be knocked
back into the puddles dropped by the non-doomed players, cleansing their debuffs.

**Thordan** and **The Eye** will return from Phase 2. Note their positions outside the arena as they
will cast a gaze attack.

The non-doomed players will receive either Cross, Square, or Triangle markers:
- **Crosses** will always be north and south (you can pre-position for this possibility)
- **Square/Triangle** non-dooms should position opposite to their doomed partners who are already
  anchored in position

#### Knockback Resolution

As everyone prepares for knockback, face away from **Thordan** and **The Eye**, who will cast a gaze
attack similar to Phase 2. All players will be knocked back to either a cardinal or intercardinal position.

**Doom** players must immediately stand in the cleansing puddles, and everyone must reach the wall to
break their chains and spread for the AoEs that follow (similar to Phase 1).

After successfully resolving this mechanic, regroup in the center for healing.

#### Meteor Phase

As **"Death of the Heavens"** concludes and everyone gathers in the middle, 8 meteors will spawn around
the arena. These must all be destroyed before they hit the ground, or the arena will explode and wipe the raid.

A Caster Limit Break 2 should be used on 3 meteors to help destroy them quickly. Typically, the LB is
targeted on the meteors around the A marker. If your caster is dead, a Ranged LB 2 can be used as a backup.
All other meteors must be defeated through normal damage.

### Phase 5 Conclusion

Once all meteors are destroyed, **Thordan** will return to the arena and cast **"Ancient Quaga"**, a
raid-wide attack. This is followed by one auto-attack and another combo of **"Heavenly Heel"** and
**"Ascalon's Might"**. Depending on your tank composition, these attacks will either be invulned or mitigated.
Refer to the tank mitigation sheet for specific details.

**Thordan** will perform one final auto-attack before beginning his enrage.

> **Important**: Do not kill **Thordan** completely. Reduce him to approximately 2% HP only.
> Sparing his life will cause him to jump away, allowing you to continue to Phase 7 later.

---

## [P6: Nidhogg and Hraesvelgr](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=426762112878561&preview=1)

In this phase, you will be facing off against both **Nidhogg** (West) and **Hraesvelgr** (East). There
are several important mechanics and considerations throughout this phase.

> Tanks must grab aggro on their assigned dragon as they will perform auto-attacks throughout the phase.

**Important phase mechanics**:

- If **Hraesvelgr** kills any party member, his **"Solemn Vow"** will be broken, granting him a damage
  up buff that acts as a soft enrage. Any player taking damage from him afterward will likely be killed.

- Throughout this fight, you must keep both dragons' health within 3% of each other at specific times
  (similar to TEA's Hand of Pain). This is especially critical during **"Akh Afah"** casts.

- **"Mortal Vow"** is a debuff that will be passed between players throughout the fight. It reduces the
  affected player's healing output (not healing received) and explodes in an AoE when it expires. If
  another player is in this AoE, they receive the debuff. If not passed, **Nidhogg** will soft enrage
  similar to **Hraesvelgr**.

> If more than one person is hit by the **"Mortal Vow"** pass, the new recipient will have their maximum
> HP cut in half. The debuff also applies a small DoT to the affected player.
>
> If a player with **"Mortal Vow"** dies, the debuff will still explode from their body when it expires,
> allowing another player to pick it up.

The standard **"Mortal Vow"** passing order is:
- Random DPS > G1 Tank > G2 Tank > G1 Melee (G2 Melee if G1 Melee was initial vow) > Caster

For DPS assignment, split by light parties:
- Light Party 1: Focus on **Nidhogg**
- Light Party 2: Focus on **Hraesvelgr**

### Wyrmsbreath 1

Shortly after the phase begins, both dragons will cast **"Wyrmsbreath"**. During this mechanic:

- A donut AoE will cover the outside of the arena
- Both bosses will tether to 3 random non-tank players each with orange and blue tethers
- These tethers result in cone AoEs that apply either a freezing or burning debuff (fatal if not handled)
- Both dragons will prepare tank busters

#### Tether Resolution

Tethers are proximity-based and must be stretched. An indicator will show if you're too close. To negate
the harmful debuffs, each non-tank must be hit by both elements.

The DPS and Healers will spread in a triangle formation with pairs positioned together:
- Melee should start near the 1 marker
- Group 1 ranged: Southwest
- Group 2 ranged: Southeast

Each pair needs an "anchor" player (typically healers for ranged pairs and one designated melee).
When tethers are assigned, pairs may need to flex positions to ensure opposite tether types within
each pair.

Safe positions are:
- Melee/flex: At the corners of the 1 marker opposite your tethered dragon
- Group 1 Healer/Ranged/flex: Southwest
- Group 2 Healer/Ranged/flex: Southeast

> Use the outside AoE telegraph and the two brick lines in the middle as positioning guides.

#### Tank Busters

While the party handles tethers, both dragons will prepare tank busters. There are two possible variations:

1. **Both mouths glowing**: This indicates a shared tank buster. Tanks should share this buster around
   the middle of the arena.

2. **One mouth glowing**: The tank whose dragon is not glowing will take a solo buster (large AoE).
   The non-busting dragon will cleave the middle of the arena. Both tanks should move toward the north
   corner of their dragon within the safe area inside the donut AoE.

#### Mortal Vow Assigned

After **"Wyrmsbreath"** resolves, **"Mortal Vow"** will be applied to a random DPS. DPS players should
spread, while support groups up in the middle.

#### Akh Afah 1

Once **"Mortal Vow"** is applied, split into your light parties for **"Akh Afah"**:
- Light Party 1: North
- Light Party 2: South

During this mechanic, both dragons cast **"Akh Afah"** (stack markers on each healer). Both dragons must
be within 3% HP of each other, or **Hraesvelgr's** stack will instantly kill its targets, causing him to
enrage. Mitigate these stacks appropriately as they deal heavy damage.

### Hallowed Wings 1

After **"Akh Afah"**, **Nidhogg** will fly outside the arena, positioning North or South on either the
West or East half. From this position, he will cleave one half of the arena. Simultaneously, **Hraesvelgr**
will cast **"Hallowed Wing"** to cut off either the North or South side, leaving only a single quadrant safe.

> The party should always position near the middle of the arena at the start of this mechanic.

**Hraesvelgr** will also prepare a tank buster targeting either the closest or furthest players, depending
on his head position:
- Head up: Targets furthest players (Tanks far, Party close)
- Head down: Targets closest players (Tanks close, Party far)

The party should position at either the edge of the arena or near the middle (depending on the cleaves),
ensuring they avoid all cleave areas. Tanks must spread between the middle and edge of the arena as the
tank busters cover a large area.

> Ensure the wall tank remains inside the hitbox without overlapping the other tank, and the party stays
> outside the hitbox.

#### Mortal Vow 1st Pass

After the tank busters resolve, everyone should move away from the center as the first **"Mortal Vow"**
pass will occur. The DPS with the debuff will pass it to the Group 1 tank.

### Wroth Flames

During this mechanic, **Hraesvelgr** will jump to one side of the arena (similar to **Nidhogg** previously)
and cleave part of the arena. He will appear in one of three positions:
- Far West
- Middle
- Far East

He will also be positioned either North or South. Far East/West positions will cause him to cleave half
the arena in front of him. A middle position will result in the middle half being cleaved, leaving only
quarters of the room safe along the East and West walls.

Three sets of delayed orbs will spawn and explode in cross-shaped patterns:
- First orb: Always spawns in the middle
- Second and third orbs: Spawn in opposite corners

Players will receive debuffs as follows:
- Four players: Red "spread" debuff (small circle AoE when expired)
- Two players: White debuff (two-person stack AoE)
- Two players: No debuff (must choose a White debuff player to stack with)

Simultaneously, **Nidhogg** will cast **"Akh Morn"** on a random player (8-person stack). There will be
4 **"Akh Morns"** total, each leaving a puddle on impact. Standing in these puddles causes a lethal bleed.

To resolve this mechanic:
1. Start near a corner and dodge to the center
2. Determine your starting location based on **Hraesvelgr's** position and orb spawns
3. Stack for **"Akh Morns"** and move as a group from puddle to puddle, making a J-shape after the third hit
4. Move to spread positions in the direction of the J-shape

**Nidhogg** will then cast either **"Hot Tail"** or **"Hot Wing"**:
- **"Hot Wing"**: Cleaves North and South sides, leaving a rectangular safe spot in the middle
- **"Hot Tail"**: Cleaves the middle, leaving North and South sides safe

Player positions after puddles:
- Red debuff players: Spread toward **Nidhogg**
- White debuff + no debuff pairs: Position in the middle or edge toward **Hraesvelgr**

> NA Party Finder typically uses a marker system:
> - Red debuff players: "Target to Attack" 1-4 (1 at West wall, 4 toward middle)
> - One White + one no debuff pair: "Target to Ignore" 1-2 (slightly East of center)
> - One White + one no debuff pair: "Target to Bind" 1-2 (East wall)
>
> This creates a lineup from West to East: Attack 1, 2, 3, 4, Ignore, and Bind.

#### Mortal Vow 2nd Pass

After **"Wroth Flames"** resolves, the second **"Mortal Vow"** pass will occur between the tanks.

#### Akh Afah 2

Another **"Akh Afah"** follows. Ensure both dragons remain within 3% HP of each other to prevent
**Hraesvelgr's** vow from breaking.

### Hallowed Wings 2

After the second **"Akh Afah"**, another **"Hallowed Wings"** will occur, similar to the first with
one key difference: **Nidhogg** will cast **"Hot Wing"** or **"Hot Tail"** instead of diving across
the arena.

To resolve this mechanic:
1. Check **Hraesvelgr's** glowing wing. Stand on the non-glowing side.
2. Check **Hraesvelgr's** head position:
   - Head up: Party close, tanks far
   - Head down: Tanks close, party far
3. Check **Nidhogg's** cast:
   - **"Hot Wing"**: Stand in the center
   - **"Hot Tail"**: Stand on the sides

Tanks should spread from each other and the party. One tank will stand in the middle of the arena in
the safe zone, while the other tank positions at the East or West wall, depending on the buster.

#### Mortal Vow 3rd Pass

After the mechanic resolves, pass **"Mortal Vow"** to the next person in line at the center of the arena.

### Wyrmsbreath 2

Right after **"Hallowed Wings 2"**, the phase continues with another **"Wyrmsbreath"**. While the mechanic
is technically the same, the strategy differs. Instead of being hit by both tethers, players should only
be hit by one, as these debuffs will need to be dispelled in the next mechanic.

For NA strats, "WB2" positioning is used. See the image below for a visual representation of the positioning.

![Wyrmsbreath 2 Positioning](/images/ultimates/dsr/static-wb2.png)

Each player goes to their assigned position. Only the tanks will adjust based on which pattern of tank
busters the dragons use.

### Cauterize & Touchdown

After the tethers resolve, three players should have a fire debuff, and three should have an ice debuff.
Both dragons will appear on the North wall of the arena and cast **"Cauterize"** and **"Touchdown"**,
diving through the arena.

Go to the dragon that is the opposite element of the tether you received. Tanks must ensure they are
the closest player to the dragons, as the first player in line takes a tank buster when the dragons dive.
This requires heavy mitigation.

> Be mindful if you have **"Pyretic"** - even a single tick is enough to lower your HP to a point where
> **"Cauterize"** will kill you. The DPS check is not difficult, so excessive greed is unnecessary.

Healers should monitor the tanks' HP closely, as **"Cauterize"** applies a long-lasting DoT effect.
The tank with the ice DoT requires special attention, as their death would trigger **Hraesvelgr's** enrage.

**Nidhogg** will dive onto the middle of the arena, dealing proximity-based raidwide damage. Move toward
the North wall to minimize damage. **Hraesvelgr** will do the same simultaneously but from the South wall.

#### Mortal Vow 4th Pass

Pass **"Mortal Vow"** one last time at the wall.

### Revenge of the Horde

Both **Hraesvelgr** and **Nidhogg** will now start casting **"Revenge of the Horde"**. Defeat them both
before the cast ends.

> **Important**: If you spared **Thordan** in Phase 5 (kept him at 2% HP), you will now face him again in
> Phase 7. If you killed him instead, you will wipe.

Before entering Phase 7, you will see a transition sequence with heavy-hitting raidwide AoEs from
**Thordan** that apply bleeds, followed by a massive raidwide attack. The bleed AoEs cannot be mitigated,
as you'll need mitigation for the final attack. Healers must heal through the bleeds.

When **Thordan** casts his second bleed, prepare to mitigate his final attack, **"Alternative End"**.
Apply mitigation as soon as the second bleed expires. If executed correctly, you will enter the arena
with **Dragon-King Thordan** for the final phase.

## P7: [The Dragon King](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=448767858029561&preview=1)

Phase 7 serves as a victory lap with straightforward mechanics that repeat in a predictable pattern. 
The phase consists of three primary mechanics with **"Trinity Auto Attacks"** between each one. 
The phase concludes with **"Morn Afah's Edge"**, the enrage sequence.

## Core Mechanics Overview

The mechanics repeat in this pattern:
1. **"Exaflare's Edge"** (occurs three times)
2. **"Akh Morn's Edge"** (occurs three times)
3. **"Gigaflare's Edge"** (occurs twice)

Each major mechanic begins with a point-blank or donut AoE that must be dodged based on 
**Thordan's** sword color:
- **Blue glow**: Stand inside his hitbox
- **Red glow**: Stand outside his hitbox

## Auto Attack Management

After each major mechanic, **Thordan** performs **two separate sequences** of auto attacks in quick 
succession. During each sequence, he simultaneously targets three players:

- **Tank with aggro** receives 1 stack of **"Light Vulnerability"**
- **Tank without aggro** receives 1 stack of **"Dark Vulnerability"**
- The closest non-tank player receives a **"Physical Vulnerability"** debuff

Each auto attack creates a small AoE around the targeted player. Positioning for auto attacks:
- **Tank with aggro**: Face **Thordan** north
- **Tank without aggro**: Position at **Thordan's** right hand
- **DPS/Healer baiter**: Position directly under the boss
- **Rest of party**: Stand away from the tanks and baiter to avoid cleaves

**Important:** Taking a second auto attack with a **"Physical Vulnerability"** debuff will result in 
death. Non-tank players must take turns baiting these attacks according to this rotation:

**After Exaflare's Edge:**
- First sequence: Melee DPS 1
- Second sequence: Melee DPS 2

**After Akh Morn's Edge:**
- First sequence: Ranged DPS 1
- Second sequence: Ranged DPS 2

**After Gigaflare's Edge:**
- First sequence: Healer 1
- Second sequence: Healer 2

**Tank swaps:** The tank without aggro should Provoke as soon as the cast bar for the next major 
mechanic locks in. This tank swap reduces the damage from vulnerability stacks.

## Exaflare's Edge

**Thordan** will create moving AoE patterns that originate from him. The main tank should position 
**Thordan** facing directly north.

To safely dodge the Exaflares:

1. Position at the edge of the South Exaflare before the cast finishes.

2. When the cast completes, immediately move to the center of the South Exaflare. This window is 
   tight, so using Sprint is recommended.
   
   > Use the light pillar in the middle of the exaflare or the inside edge of NAUR markers as a 
   > positioning guide.

3. As soon as the second set of exaflares explode around you, move directly South to the point between 
   the two Blue diamonds/arena marks.

4. After successfully dodging, move slightly forward for melee uptime. Tanks should move directly 
   center first, then:
   - **Main Tank**: Break left
   - **Off Tank**: Break right

After Exaflare's Edge resolves, there will be two sets of auto attacks. The first should be baited by 
Melee 1, followed by the second set baited by Melee 2.

## Akh Morn's Edge

**Thordan** spawns three towers:
- One behind him
- One to his front left
- One to his front right

Each tower must be soaked by at least one player or the party will wipe. The towers hit multiple times, with the number 
increasing each time this mechanic occurs (5→6→7 hits).

After resolving the in/out mechanic based on sword color, step into **Thordan's** hitbox to make 
healing easier if possible.

There are two strategies for tower soaking:

1. **The 3/3/2 Method** (First occurrence only):
   - **Tank**: Rear tower
   - **Group 1**: Left tower
   - **Group 2**: Right tower

2. **The 6/1/1 Method** (Second and third occurrences):
   - **One tank**: Uses invulnerability in the rear tower (solo)
   - **Other tank**: Takes one side tower with mitigation (solo)
   - **Remaining six players**: Stack in the third tower

After Akh Morn's Edge resolves, there will be two sets of auto attacks. The first should be baited by 
Ranged 1, followed by the second set baited by Ranged 2.

## Gigaflare's Edge

Three **"Gigaflare"** proximity AoEs spawn in a triangle formation around **Thordan**. Note their 
spawn order, as you'll need to position opposite the first **"Gigaflare"**.

Based on **Thordan's** sword glow:
- **Red glow**: Stand outside the hitbox opposite the first **"Gigaflare"**
- **Blue glow**: Stand inside his hitbox opposite the first **"Gigaflare"**

> The blue safe spot is extremely small. Position precisely to avoid damage.

As each **"Gigaflare"** explodes, move clockwise or counterclockwise to remain opposite the next 
exploding **"Gigaflare"**.

After Gigaflare's Edge resolves, there will be two sets of auto attacks. The first should be baited by 
Healer 1, followed by the second set baited by Healer 2.

## Phase Timeline & Enrage

The complete sequence of events:

1. **"Exaflare's Edge"** 1 → Two **"Trinity"** auto attacks (Melee baits)
2. **"Akh Morn's Edge"** 1 → Two **"Trinity"** auto attacks (Ranged baits)
3. **"Gigaflare's Edge"** 1 → Two **"Trinity"** auto attacks (Healer baits)
4. **"Exaflare's Edge"** 2 → Two **"Trinity"** auto attacks (Melee baits)
5. **"Akh Morn's Edge"** 2 → Two **"Trinity"** auto attacks (Ranged baits)
6. **"Gigaflare's Edge"** 2 → Two **"Trinity"** auto attacks (Healer baits)
7. **"Exaflare's Edge"** 3 → Two **"Trinity"** auto attacks (Melee baits)
8. **"Akh Morn's Edge"** 3 → Two **"Trinity"** auto attacks (Ranged baits)
9. **"Morn Afah's Edge"** (Enrage)

During the enrage, three sets of lethal towers will spawn. To maximize DPS time:
- First set of towers: Both **Healers** and **Main Tank**
- Second set of towers: Both **Ranged DPS** and **Off Tank**
- Third set of towers: No players (allow to explode)

This strategy allows melee DPS to maintain maximum uptime. Since there are only 8 players and 9 
towers total, the final set would explode regardless.

> If Limit Break 3 hasn't been used by this point, a Melee DPS should use it at the start of 
> **"Morn Afah's Edge"**.

Congratulations on completing Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)!
