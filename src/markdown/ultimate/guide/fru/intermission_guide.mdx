# Intermission: Crystals

Assuming the Usurper of Frost was successfully brought below 20% in her phase, there’s a short intermission phase before phase 3.
After the <mark class="hl-ice">Absolute Zero</mark> cast, Shiva knocks everyone back from center and inflicts <Buff b="deep-freeze" /> on everyone, forcing you to wait for a brief scene.
Shiva becomes encased in ice, just like in E8N, and the arena becomes a bright icy blue.

16 seconds later, the <Buff b="deep-freeze" short /> lifts, and the crystals spawn.
4 Crystals of Light spawn on the cardinals far away from the boss, while 4 Crystals of Darkness spawn on the intercardinals close to the boss.
The crystal covering the Usurper of Frost is called the Ice Veil, and it almost immediately begins casting <mark class="hl-ice">Endless Ice Age</mark>, the enrage for the phase.
You must destroy the Veil before the cast completes to progress to phase 3.

The crystals are all tethered to the Ice Veil, granting it <Buff b="invincibility" />.
If you destroy all the adds, the <Buff b="invincibility" short /> will be removed and the Ice Veil will fall rapidly.

Gaia will also appear, channeling darkness energy into the crystal in an attempt to free Ryne.
It doesn’t seem to be doing much, though…

## Crystal Attacks

There isn’t much in the way of mechanics in this intermission.
Periodically, each of the Crystals of Light will target a large, circular AoE at the nearest player, while each fo the Crystals of Darkness will target the nearest player with a narrow cone.

Oddly, there’s no castbar for the big circles, but the narrow cones are called <mark class="hl-ice">Sinbound Blizzard</mark>.
You must be careful about aiming the cones, because if they hit a crystal, that crystal will receive <Buff b="vulnerability-down" /> for the remainder of the phase.
The <Buff b="vulnerability-down" /> lowers the damage done to a Crystal of Darkness or the Ice Veil by 80%, but makes a Crystal of Light invulnerable.

**Note:** Due to a graphical glitch, sometimes the cone omens do not render correctly.
They’re still there, and they can still hurt you.

With the second wave of AoEs, the Crystals of Light will target the nearest players with passable tethers.
After the third wave, the targeted players will be hit by a series of three <mark class="hl-cast">Hiemal Ray</mark>, small circular AoEs leaving behind puddles that inflict a DoT.

## The Eternal Ice Fragment

If you destroy all the crystals and the Ice Veil, then the crystal holding Shiva shatters and the transition to phase 3 begins.
An interactable Eternal Ice Fragment appears on the ground just in front of Shiva, but it shatters before anyone can interact with it.
If you remember your lore, one of Gaia’s key memories you saved during E12N was of Ryne and Gaia making the fragment into a necklace.
Its destruction seems portentious…

And in actual fact, while you can proceed to the end of phase 4 without the Eternal Ice Fragment, you will be unable to enter phase 5 and clear the fight.
Gaia’s voice line near the end of the phase, “Is my darkness not enough?!” is the clue to the alternate solution to the phase that’s required to clear.

Instead of killing the Crystals of Darkness, they must all be left alive.
If all four survive while the Crystals of Light die, they will begin channeling <mark class="hl-dark">dark</mark> energy into Gaia and the Ice Veil.
Note that using caster LB3 will instantly defeat the Crystals of Darkness, so it can’t normally be used if you want to clear the fight.
In order to use it safely, all four Crystals of Darkness must first be given a <Buff b="vulnerability-down" /> from <mark class="hl-ice">Sinbound Blizzard</mark>.
That said, LB3 is still a great prog tool, because the Ice Veil absolutely melts1 if all the crystals are dead and there are no consequences until after phase 4.

The Ice Veil will lose its <Buff b="invincibility" /> and gain a <Buff b="vulnerability-down" /> in its place, reducing incoming damage by 50%.
Gaia’s channeling will complete successfully, and near the end of the <mark class="hl-ice">Endless Ice Age</mark> cast, Gaia will do her enormous hammer slam from E12N and remove a full half of the Ice Veil’s health bar.

If Gaia completes the hammer attack, then instead of shattering, the Eternal Ice Fragment will be absorbed into Shiva and you will be on the path to clearing the fight.
Note that leaving the dark crystals alive is not enough: if the Ice Veil is killed before Gaia delivers her attack, then Shiva will not absorb the Fragment.
