# P1: Fatebreaker

The fight begins with Fatebreaker, the boss from E8S.
The mechanics will be quite familiar if you’ve done E11S, although there are no light attacks.
To clear the phase, Fatebreaker must be defeated completely.

This phase is largely uptime, with a single downtime mechanic.

Unless otherwise noted, any attack other than a spread, stack, raidwide, or tankbuster inflicts a

<Buff b="damage-down" dur="2m" />, and all spreads and stacks inflict a
<Buff b="magic-vuln" dur="2s" />.

## Sequence 1: Cyclonic Break

Fatebreaker immediately jumps into a mechanic sequence with a <mark class="hl-cast">Cyclonic Break</mark> cast.
During this cast, he will be surrounded by either <mark class="hl-fire">fire</mark> or <mark class="hl-electric">lightning</mark>.
This will determine whether you need to <mark class="hl-fire">stack</mark> in pairs or <mark class="hl-electric">spread</mark> during the mechanic.
There are different audio cues for the two elements: <mark class="hl-fire">fire</mark> is accompanied by a whooshing sound and <mark class="hl-electric">lightning</mark> by crackling.

The attack executes a narrow (22.5°) conal spread targeting each player, without an <u title="A puddle telegraphing an upcoming AoE">omen</u>.
These inflict <Buff b="phys-vuln" dur="2s" />, so any player hit by two or more will die.
The location of these cones is saved and will be used for the rest of the mechanic.

2 seconds after the first cones, a second set of cones go out on the same location.
These must be dodged.
At the same time, players will be hit by a <mark class="hl-fire">fire</mark> or <mark class="hl-electric">lightning</mark> attack:

- If it is <mark class="hl-fire">fire</mark>, then each <mark class="hl-dps">DPS</mark> will be hit by <mark class="hl-fire">Sinsmoke</mark>, a pair stack AoE.
  For each dead <mark class="hl-dps">DPS</mark>, the attack will hit a random <mark class="hl-support">support</mark> instead, _doubling up if fewer than four players are alive_.

- If it is <mark class="hl-electric">lightning</mark>, then all players will be hit by <mark class="hl-electric">Sinsmite</mark>, a spread AoE.

After the second set of cones and stack/spread, two more sets of cones go out, one after the other. Each is rotated clockwise from the previous by 1/16th of a circle (22.5°, i.e. one cone’s width). Like the second set, these must be dodged.

### Powder Mark Trail

As <mark class="hl-cast">Cyclonic Break</mark> resolves, Fatebreaker casts <mark class="hl-cast">Power Mark Trail</mark>, a single-target tankbuster that inflicts both <Buff b="powder-mark-trail" dur="16s" /> and <Buff b="phys-vuln" dur="14s" />.
The <Buff b="powder-mark-trail" short /> will explode if the tank dies or at the start of the next mechanic, while the <Buff b="phys-vuln" short /> will cause subsequent auto-attacks to be lethal.

## Sequence 2: Utopian Sky

Fatebreaker recenters, faces north, and begins casting <mark class="hl-cast">Utopian Sky</mark>, once again is surrounded by <mark class="hl-fire">fire</mark> or <mark class="hl-electric">lightning</mark>.
As before, this signals the upcoming <mark class="hl-fire">spread</mark> or <mark class="hl-electric">stack</mark>, and you can also tell them apart by the audio cue.

Once the cast completes, Fatebreaker goes untargetable and disappears, and the arena is be covered in a deep fog.
If you’ve played E11S, you will recognize this from <mark class="hl-cast">Prismatic Deception</mark>.
Eight Fatebreaker clones—Fatebreaker's Image—will appear just outside the arena, one in each principal direction.
Due to the fog, they can only be seen if you are nearby.
Right after they appear, the <Buff b="powder-mark-trail" short /> from earlier will expire, causing large AoE tankbusters to hit both the player originally hit by <mark class="hl-cast">Powder Mark Trail</mark> and the player nearest to them.

Three of the clones will raise their gunblades to point straight up and begin casting <mark class="hl-cast">Blasting Zone</mark>, while the rest will keep theirs facing downwards and at an angle before disappearing.
Fatebreaker reappears just before the casts complete, and begins charging a new <mark class="hl-cast">Cyclonic Break</mark>.
The <mark class="hl-fire">fire</mark> or <mark class="hl-electric">lightning</mark> element need not be the same as before.

When the <mark class="hl-cast">Blasting Zone</mark> completes, the three clones will cleave in front of them in a line.
At the same time, players will be hit by an attack depending on the element charged during the <mark class="hl-cast">Utopian Sky</mark> cast:

- <mark class="hl-fire">Sinbound Fire III</mark>, an LP stack AoE.
- <mark class="hl-electric">Sinbound Thunder III</mark>, a spread AoE.

When Fatebreaker finishes casting, the second <mark class="hl-cast">Cyclonic Break</mark> is exactly the same as the first, except that the element is random and may be different from before.

### Turn of the Heavens

During the execution of <mark class="hl-cast">Cyclonic Break</mark>, two more clones will appear: one just north of Fatebreaker, and one at the west side of the arena.
The one next to Fatebreaker casts <mark class="hl-cast">Turn of the Heavens</mark> with either <mark class="hl-fire">fire</mark> or <mark class="hl-electric">lightning</mark>, while the one on the edge will cast <mark class="hl-electric">Burnt Strike</mark>.
The audio cue indicates Fatebreaker’s element.

As the cast completes:

- Four <mark class="hl-fire">Halo of Flame</mark> and four <mark class="hl-electric">Halo of Levin</mark> appear near the outside of the arena at cardinals and intercardinals.
  They are always positioned with <mark class="hl-fire">Flame</mark> halos on the west or east side, and <mark class="hl-electric">Levin</mark> halos on the other.
  The halos begin casting <mark class="hl-cast">Brightfire</mark>.

- Two clones appear at random intercardinals, tethered to two random players, and begin casting <mark class="hl-fire">Bound of Faith</mark>.
  The tethered players also receive: <Buff b="prey" /> and <Buff b="fated-burn-mark" dur="15s" />

- One more clone appears at the north end of the arena, casting <mark class="hl-fire">Burnt Strike</mark>.

After the new adds begin casting, the first <mark class="hl-cast">Burnt Strike</mark> goes off, cleaving in a line from west to east.
The cleave repeats immediately, but is substantially wider the second time.
A few seconds later, the second <mark class="hl-cast">Burnt Strike</mark> goes off, cleaving from north to south.
The follow-up strike will hit all players with a knockback east or west, away from the center.
These knockbacks cannot be resisted.

Shortly afterwards, all the halos explode, dealing lethal damage in a circle.
The halos that do not match the element of the <mark class="hl-cast">Turn of the Heavens</mark> cast only explode directly underneath themselves.
The halos that do match will explode inside the larger circle denoted on the floor.

At the same time, the two tethered players are lifted into the air with <Buff b="floating-fetters" dur="3s" />, then charged by the adds and hit with <mark class="hl-fire">Sinsmoke</mark>.
Unlike earlier, this <mark class="hl-fire">Sinsmoke</mark> is an LP stack that inflicts <Buff b="mark-of-mortality" dur="2m" /> if it hits fewer than 4 players.
If the tethered player died, a random player will be targeted instead.

### Burnished Glory

Fatebreaker reappears shortly after <mark class="hl-fire">Sinsmoke</mark>, and is immediately targetable.
The sequence wraps up with <mark class="hl-cast">Burnished Glory</mark>, a raidwide that inflicts a heavy <Buff b="bleeding" dur="15s" />.

## Sequence 3: Fall of Faith

The third sequence begins with a <mark class="hl-cast">Fall of Faith</mark> cast.
Fatebreaker will glow with <mark class="hl-fire">fire</mark> or <mark class="hl-electric">lightning</mark> energy, and mark a player with a tether and <Buff b="prey" />.
The tether will glow <mark class="hl-fire">red</mark> or <mark class="hl-electric">blue</mark> depending on the element being charged.

Over the course of the cast, three clones will appear at the NW, N, and NE edges of the arena, in that order.
Each will begin casting its own <mark class="hl-cast">Fall of Faith</mark> with its own tether and <Buff b="prey" short />, for a total of four on four different targets.

When the casts complete, similar to the end of the previous sequence, the boss or clone will lift their target into the air with <Buff b="floating-fetters" dur="3s" /> and charge at them.
The attack is either <mark class="hl-fire">Sinblaze</mark> or <mark class="hl-electric">Sinsmite</mark>, depending on the element, but with completely new mechanics:

- <mark class="hl-fire">Sinblaze</mark> hits the targeted player as well as
  producing a 90° cone originating from the target, aimed towards the nearest
  player. The entire attack is an LP stack so to satisfy the stack, there must
  be at least three players inside the cone, plus the main target. If there are
  fewer than four players total hit by the attack, it will inflict
  <Buff b="mark-of-mortality" dur="2m" />.

- <mark class="hl-electric">Sinsmite</mark> hits the targeted player and
  produces three 120° cones originating from them, aimed towards the three
  nearest players. Because these are so wide, positioning is critical.

Both <mark class="hl-fire">Sinblaze</mark> and <mark class="hl-electric">Sinsmite</mark> inflict <Buff b="magic-vuln" dur="4s" />, which lasts until after the next attack in the sequence.
Thus, a player hit by two consecutive attacks will die.

Fatebreaker completes the sequence with another <mark class="hl-cast">Burnished Glory</mark> and another <mark class="hl-cast">Powder Mark Trail</mark>.
Note that the DoT from the <mark class="hl-cast">Burnished Glory</mark> will make the tankbuster require more mitigation/healing than the first time.

## Sequence 4: Burnt Strike

Fatebreaker casts <mark class="hl-cast">Burnt Strike</mark>, glowing with <mark class="hl-fire">fire</mark> or <mark class="hl-electric">lightning</mark>.
As he does so, three towers appear along the east or west edge of the arena.
The total number of players required for the towers is always 6, but the distribution is random: it could be 1/1/4, 1/2/3, or 2/2/2 in any order.

The <mark class="hl-cast">Burnt Strike</mark> is a north-south line cleave, followed by:

- For <mark class="hl-fire">fire</mark>, all players are knocked back east or west away from the center.
- For <mark class="hl-electric">lightning</mark>, a second, wider line cleave.

Right after the follow-up attack, the towers will go off and, at the same time, the <Buff b="powder-mark-trail" /> detonates on its target and the newest player.
If a tower is missed, it explodes in a heavy raidwide with <Buff b="damage-down" dur="2m" short />.

## Enrage

Fatebreaker now casts <mark class="hl-cast">Burnished Glory</mark> for a third and final time, with a long castbar.
If the cast succeeds, the party wipes.
To proceed to the next phase, Fatebreaker must be killed before the cast completes.
