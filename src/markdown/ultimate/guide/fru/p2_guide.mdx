# P2: Usurper of Frost

As soon as Fatebreaker dies, the arena transitions to Shiva’s arena from E8S, and Shiva herself appears.
Although she looks the same, Ryne is possessed by Mitron and is called the Usurper of Frost.
But everyone still calls her Shiva.

This phase is the closest that FRU has to a trio phase, with two long downtime mechanics.
Unlike a traditional trio phase, however, there is a little bit of uptime mechanic sprinkled in.
To complete the phase, she must be brought down below 20% health before the end of the enrage.
Also, unlike in the original fight, the edge of the arena is not a cliff but stays as the traditional Ultimate deathwall.

As before, unless otherwise noted, any attack other than a spread, stack, raidwide, or tankbuster inflicts <Buff b="damage-down" dur="2m" />, and all spreads and stacks inflict <Buff b="magic-vuln" dur="2s" /> to prevent players from taking multiple hits.

## Intro

Shiva kicks things off with <mark class="hl-cast">Quadruple Slap</mark>, a tankbuster that only actually has two hits.
It’s a typical one-two buster with room for a tank swap.
It inflicts a cleansable <Buff b="phys-vuln" dur="25s" cleansable />, forcing a swap, cleanse, or invuln.

After one follow-up auto—which can also be lethal, thanks to the vuln—Shiva teleports to south of center, faces north, and begins casting <mark class="hl-cast">Mirror Image</mark>.
This cast has no associated attack, but summons a <mark class="hl-light">light-form</mark> clone, the Oracle's Reflection, directly in the center of the arena.
The Usurper of Frost herself remains in <mark class="hl-ice">ice form</mark>.
The two of them will bounce around a lot during the next mechanic.

## Sequence 1: Diamond Dust

### AoE Hell

Once the Reflection appears, Shiva casts <mark class="hl-ice">Diamond Dust</mark>, a raidwide that kicks off the real mechanic.
Note that the raidwide is slightly delayed from the end of the cast.
Don’t mitigate too early.
Shiva herself disappears, kicking off the long downtime mechanic.

Three different things happen in rapid succession:

1. It wouldn’t be a Shiva fight without the classic circular AoEs around the outside of the arena.
2. The Oracle's Reflection begins casting either <mark class="hl-light">Axe Kick</mark> or <mark class="hl-light">Scythe Kick</mark>.
3. Four players–all <mark class="hl-dps">DPS</mark> or all <mark class="hl-support">supports</mark>–are targeted by markers with a circular yellow omen.

All of these mechanics, and more, need to be solved simultaneously.

1.  <span title="Puddle telegraphing an upcoming AoE">Omens</span> for the
    classic circle AoEs—the true <mark class="hl-ice">Diamond Dust</mark>—appear
    in the <span title="Cardinals or intercardinals">principal directions</span>
    in three waves. The first wave has two circles, appearing opposite one
    another.

        The second wave spreads out from the first wave: If the first wave was on a pair of cardinals, then the second wave will be on the four intercardinals.

    Conversely, if the first wave was on intercardinals, then the second wave will be on the four cardinals.

        The third wave will hit the two remaining cardinals or intercardinals, at 90° from the first wave.

    All three waves must be completely dodged.

2.  The Oracle's Reflection’s cast will be either a point-blank (<mark class="hl-light">Axe Kick</mark>) or a donut (<mark class="hl-light">Scythe Kick</mark>).
    These AoEs are very big: 1. The point-blank <mark class="hl-light">Axe Kick</mark> goes all the way out to the outer line/circle on the floor. 2. The donut <mark class="hl-light">Scythe Kick</mark> extends to well within the Reflection’s hitbox.
    The safe area is only as wide as the small four-pointed star within the inner circle.

        The two attacks can be distinguished by her voice line: <mark class="hl-light">Axe Kick</mark> is accompanied by “Cleave!”, and <mark class="hl-light">Scythe Kick</mark> by “Reap!”

        At the same time as the point-blank or donut, the Reflection also shoots out four <mark class="hl-light">The House of Light</mark> cones at the four nearest players.

    These cones, combined with the four marker AoEs, create an 8-way spread.

3.  The four circular markers go off moments after the kick, hitting their targets with <mark class="hl-ice">Frigid Stone</mark> at the same time as the first <mark class="hl-ice">Diamond Dust</mark> circles go off.
    These drop a second set of AoEs, 8-way lines, with the omens appearing a few seconds after the <mark class="hl-ice">Frigid Stones</mark> hit.
    These 8-way lines are similar to the ones during <mark class="hl-cast">Icelit Dragonsong</mark> in phase 2 of E8S.

4.  The Oracle's Reflection moves out towards a principal direction and begins casting <mark class="hl-light">Sinbound Holy</mark>, while the Usurper of Frost reappears in the center of the arena.
    You will likely want to pay attention to the Reflection’s location, as it’s important later.

        Without any warning, the Usurper performs <mark class="hl-ice">Heavenly Strike</mark>, a knockback raidwide, and disappears.

    This is the point where the second set of <mark class="hl-ice">Diamond Dust</mark> AoEs go off.
    You must get knocked back into a spot that’s safe from both the line AoEs and <mark class="hl-ice">Diamond Dust</mark>, with the final circles going off almost simultaneous with the lines.

After all of this, it isn’t even over.

### Thin Ice

Right after the lines go off, <mark class="hl-light">Sinbound Holy</mark> targets both <mark class="hl-healer">healers</mark> with four LP stacks each, in quick succession.
Each hit leaves behind a puddle that inflicts <Buff b="bleeding-2" />, forcing the party to keep moving.

As players run away from <mark class="hl-cast">Sinbound Holy</mark>, the Usurper of Frost moves to the edge of the arena, in a random principal direction.

About 4 seconds after the last puddle drops, without any other warning, she uses <mark class="hl-ice">Shining Armor</mark>.
This is a gaze attack that inflicts <Buff b="damage-down" dur="2m" /> and <Buff b="stun" dur="8s" />.
The stun will make impossible to pass the next part of the mechanic, so you can’t look at Shiva no matter how hot she is.

Additionally, the arena will become <Buff b="thin-ice" /> icy.
Moving will now send a player sliding most of the way across the arena.
Two bosses will also swap appearances.
The Usurper of Frost changes to <mark class="hl-light">light form</mark>, and will remain so for the rest of the phase, at the same time as the Oracle's Reflection changes to <mark class="hl-ice">ice form</mark>.

### Stillness & Silence

The Usurper will disappear while the Reflection begins casting either <mark class="hl-ice">Twin Stillness</mark> or <mark class="hl-ice">Twin Silence</mark>.
Which attack she is using is also telegraphed by her voice line (and accompanying caption): either <mark class="hl-ice">"In stillness freeze!"</mark> or <mark class="hl-ice">"Sink into silence!"</mark>

If she uses <mark class="hl-ice">Stillness</mark>, she will first cleave a massive 270° in front of her, leaving only a small safe area behind.
She will then cleave 90° her, hitting exactly the small area that was just safe.
If she uses <mark class="hl-ice">Silence</mark>, she does the exact opposite, first with a small cleave behind then a very large cleave in front.
Both cleaves are one-shots.

The snapshot on the first attack is right at the end of the first cast bar, with the second coming earlier than you might expect.
In practice, the long slide required to get behind her, versus the short slide to get in front of her, mean that you have to move slightly earlier for <mark class="hl-ice">Stillness</mark>.

The sequence finally wraps up as the Usurper of Frost reappears, targetable, in the center of the arena.

## Sequence 2: Mirror, Mirror

### Hallowed Ray

Immediately after reappearing, the Usurper begins casting <mark class="hl-cast">Hallowed Ray</mark>.
This is a full-party stack line AoE on a random player.

The only thing of note is that the attack direction snapshots quite early, so it’s actually possible for the targeted player to dodge it entirely.
This is not consistent, however, so it can’t be used to avoid the mechanic.

### Mirror, Mirror

Her next cast is <mark class="hl-cast">Mirror, Mirror</mark>.
This move summons three Frozen Mirrors around the edge of the arena at principal directions.
There will be two red mirrors and one blue mirror.
The red mirrors will always be 90° apart, but the blue mirror can be anywhere, including in between them.

The Usurper begins casting <mark class="hl-light">Scythe Kick</mark> which is the same as before: a large donut with a very small hole, and four protean cones at the nearest four players.
At exactly the same time, however, the blue mirror will also use the exact same move.
Since <mark class="hl-light">Scythe Kick</mark> on its own is a four-way spread, two copies of it make for an eight-way spread.

Right afterwards, the two red mirrors cast <mark class="hl-light">Reflected Scythe Kick</mark>.
Unsurprisingly, this is the exact same move.
But it must be solved so that none of the players clip each other.

Each of the mirrors disappears shortly after

### Banish III

Shiva’s last cast in this segment is <mark class="hl-cast">Banish III</mark>, which she begins casting right as the <mark class="hl-light">Reflected Scythe Kicks</mark>.
During the cast, she’ll have a ring of light above her head, with either a single orb or four orbs orbiting on it.

If there’s only one orb, the attack is a pair stack targeted on <mark class="hl-dps">DPS</mark>.
If there’s four, it’s a spread targeted on <mark class="hl-dps">DPS</mark>.
Unlike in E8S, there are no indicators over individual players’ heads.

## Sequence 3: Light Rampant

The infamous mechanic from E8S is back, although it’s arguably not even as bad.
Naturally enough, it kicks off with a teleport to center and the <mark class="hl-light">Light Rampant</mark> castbar.
There’s a raidwide on this one, so make sure mits and shields are up.

This mechanic makes use of the <Buff b="lightsteeped" /> debuff, given out by various attacks through the mechanic:

<table class="small-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Source</th>
      <th>Total Stacks</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <mark class="hl-light">Light Rampant</mark>
      </td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>First wave towers</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <mark class="hl-light">Powerful Light</mark> stacks
      </td>
      <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Second wave tower</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <mark class="hl-light">House of Light</mark> spread
      </td>
      <td>8</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

This is a total of 32 stacks, which is exactly enough to give 4 <Buff b="lightsteeped" short /> to every player.
This is very convenient, because 5 <Buff b="lightsteeped" short /> causes a wipe.
Everyone must get exactly four stacks.

The initial raidwide doles out several markers and debuffs.
It is believed that these are given out completely at random, with no role-based patterns.

- Two players receive a pink marker with a circular AoE omen.

- The remaining six players each receive <Buff b="chains-of-everlasting-light" dur="10s" />, visibly displaying as tethers connecting them to two other players.
  These tethers are not yet active.
  - Two of these players receive <Buff b="the-weight-of-light" dur="16s" />, indicated by large golden orbs above their heads.

- Six stacks of <Buff b="lightsteeped" dur="36" /> are distributed.
  The players with markers each receive one stack, and the remaining four are distributed randomly amongst all eight players.

      So a player with a marker can receive 1 or 2 stacks, while a player with a tether can receive 0 or 1.

While the debuffs are mostly random, the tethers are not.
The two players with golden orbs are _always_ tethered together.
Additionally, _provided the players stand roughly equally spaced_, the tethers will not spawn crossed.3

### First Wave Towers

A moment after the cast, Shiva disappears and six towers appear.
The orientation is always the same: a perfect hexagon with points to the north and south.

The markers begin going off first with a series of four <mark class="hl-light">Luminous Hammer</mark> attacks each.
These inflict <Buff b="magic-vuln" dur="1s" />, but more importantly they drop lethal puddles on the ground like <mark class="hl-light">Sinbound Holy</mark>.
Don’t stand in bad.

The towers go off simultaneously with the third set of puddles, inflicting <Buff b="lightsteeped" dur="36s" />.
A missed tower is a heavy raidwide with a <Buff b="damage-down" dur="2m" />.
Although the towers do not inflict a <Buff b="magic-vuln" short /> themselves, they are magic damage, so players taking a tower cannot also be hit by a <mark class="hl-light">Luminous Hammer</mark>.

At the same time as the towers go off, the <Buff b="chains-of-everlasting-light" short /> expire, becoming <Buff b="curse-of-everlasting-light" dur="9s" />.
This is indicated by the orbs in the middle of the tethers growing more brightly.
Unlike in the original Light Rampant, for these tethers there is no maximum distance, but if any two tethered players get too close together before the debuffs expire, they will explode and cause a wipe.

### Orbs

The six silver orbs that descended on the towers, Holy Lights, hover in place above the ground.

Three of them, in an equilateral triangle, begin casting <mark class="hl-cast">Burst</mark> and display large circular omens.
The other three follow suit shortly after.
This is very similar to the fists during the phase 4 transition of TOP, if you are familiar with that fight.

As the second wave of omens appears, the <Buff b="the-weight-of-light" short /> detonate in a small circular AoE.
This is <mark class="hl-light">Powerful Light</mark>, a LP stack that inflicts <Buff b="lightsteeped" short dur="36s" />.
If fewer than 4 players are in the stack, it additionally inflicts <Buff b="mark-of-mortality" dur="2m" />.
A 4-stack tower also appears in the center of the arena at the same time.

After the <mark class="hl-light">Powerful Light</mark>—but not right after, so don’t move too soon!—the first wave of orbs explodes.
The puddles begin disappearing in the sequence they were dropped, and the second wave of orbs explodes as Shiva reappears in the center.
She remains untargetable as she begins casting <mark class="hl-cast">Banish III</mark>.
The telegraph and effects are identical to the first time she used it.

### Second Wave Tower

4 players must soak the tower to prevent the <Buff b="damage-down" dur="2m" /> raidwide and receive a stack of <Buff b="lightsteeped" dur="36s" short />.
Care must be taken that nobody takes on too many stacks.

<mark class="hl-cast">Banish III</mark> resolves a few seconds later.

Shiva wraps the mechanic up by casting <mark class="hl-light">House of Light</mark>, becoming targetable at the start of the cast.

<mark class="hl-light">House of Light</mark> is an 8-way cone spread. This
inflicts a final stack of <Buff b="lightsteeped" dur="36s" short /> on every
player. If executed correctly, everyone should now have 4 stacks. They will fall
off harmlessly during the transition to the intermission.

## Enrage

The phase ends with Shiva casting <mark class="hl-ice">Absolute Zero</mark>, the enrage.
If the party does not bring her below 20% HP before it completes, it deals infinite damage and wipes the party.
If she is brought below 20%, however, it is only a heavy raidwide.
As the transition to the intermission begins, she knocks every back from the center, so don’t stand too far out and get pushed into the wall.
