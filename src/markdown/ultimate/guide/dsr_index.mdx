Welcome to NAUR's in-depth guide for Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate).

This guide will cover each phase in detail and provide tips to help you clear and understand the fight.
All of the strategies featured in this guide follow NA PF Strats.
These strats are commonly referred to as APD or NAUR strats.

## Pre-Fight Notes

Before reading the guide, there are a couple things to note about the fight:

1. To unlock DSR, you will need to have cleared "**Asphodelos: The Fourth Circle (Savage)**" and then
   speak to the Wandering Minstrel in Old Sharlayan.

2. When entering the instance, all players should try to be equipped with Best in Slot (BiS) gear
   as well as the highest tier of food and tinctures available. BiS gear is not entirely required
   to clear the fight but it will make the fight easier and more manageable with mistakes.
   Feel free to refer to the
   [NAUR - Current FFXIV Ultimate BiS Sets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V5HIN_yUxc-PIQQDv8zKkQ9TQNZ3OxQc66AxKIC_KaQ)
   spreadsheet for some example sets.

3. To better utilize this guide, please refer to the resources found in the
   [DSR resource page](/ultimate/dsr). Many resources such as raidplans, mitigation plans,
   cheat sheets, and more can be found there.

4. It should also be noted that if a player fails a mechanic in this fight, they will often
   receive a "**Damage Down**".

   > The "**Damage Down**" debuff in DSR will reduce the damage dealt by the player by 50% for 3 minutes.
   > In most cases, it is recommended for players to die when they receive this debuff as the
   > "**Weakness**" debuff is shorter and reduces less damage. This is not always the case as some
   > mechanics will require you to stay alive to resolve them but good to keep in mind.

5. All phases and major mechanics follow the Raidplans and Toolboxes found in the
   [DSR resource page](/ultimate/dsr). These links are also attached to the respective phase or mechanic headings.
   If a heading is underlined with a hyperlink, it will take you to the respective toolbox or raidplan.
