# [P7: Dragon-king Thordan](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=448767858029561&preview=1)

Phase 7 features a tight, rhythmic pattern of mechanics centered around three repeating "Edge" attacks:
- **Exaflare's Edge** (3x)
- **Akh Morn's Edge** (3x)
- **Gigaflare's Edge** (2x)

Each is followed by **two sets of auto attacks** via the **Trinity** mechanic, which target three players at once.

The phase ends with **Morn Afahâ€™s Edge**, a hard enrage involving lethal tower soaks.

## Core Mechanics Overview

This phase features a repeated pattern of Edge mechanics:
1. **Exaflareâ€™s Edge** (3 times)
2. **Akh Mornâ€™s Edge** (3 times)
3. **Gigaflareâ€™s Edge** (2 times)

Each Edge mechanic is paired with:
- An **In/Out check**, based on sword glow
- A follow-up of **two Trinity autos**

### Sword Color In/Out Guide:

- **Blue Sword (Ice of Ascalon)** â†’ **Donut AoE** â†’ Stand **inside** his hitbox
- **Red Sword (Flames of Ascalon)** â†’ **Point-blank AoE** â†’ Stand **outside** his hitbox

> This always occurs **first**, before resolving the rest of the mechanic (Exaflare, Akh Morn, or Gigaflare).
> Tanks must **swap every set of mechanic** to avoid overlapping Light/Dark resistance debuffs.

### Trinity Auto Attacks

After each major mechanic, **Thordan** targets three players:

- **Highest enmity tank** â†’ Dark Resistance Down
- **Second enmity tank** â†’ Light Resistance Down
- **Closest non-tank** â†’ Light + Dark Resistance Down + Physical Vulnerability Up

Each auto is a small AoE. If a player with Physical Vulnerability Up is hit again, they will die.

### Positioning

- **Main Tank**: Face boss north
- **Off Tank**: Thordanâ€™s right hand
- **Baiter (non-tank)**: Directly under the boss
- **Rest of party**: Away from all three to avoid cleaves

### Baiting Rotation

| After...           | 1st Auto        | 2nd Auto        |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Exaflareâ€™s Edge    | Melee DPS 1      | Melee DPS 2      |
| Akh Mornâ€™s Edge    | Ranged DPS 1     | Ranged DPS 2     |
| Gigaflareâ€™s Edge   | Healer 1         | Healer 2         |

>  Tank swap after each set to reset resistance stacks. 

##  Exaflareâ€™s Edge
{/* todo: Images */}
Thordan summons **three triple-directional Exaflare spawners** around him. Each fires **moving AoEs** in its direction after a short delay. Being hit is fatal.

Each Exaflare begins with a **sword glow**:

- ðŸ”µ **Blue sword (Ice of Ascalon)** â†’ Start **in** (donut AoE)
- ðŸ”´ **Red sword (Flames of Ascalon)** â†’ Start **out** (point-blank AoE) 

### Strategy

1. **Start South**: Position at the edge of the **Southern Exaflare**
   - Use **Sprint** and visual cues like the **light pillar** or **arena markers** for the dodge.
2. **First dodge**: As soon as the cast finishes, **step into** the center of the South flare path
3. **Second dodge**: After the AoE near you explodes, move **further South** (between the two blue diamonds)
4. **Finish**: After all Exaflares resolve, move **slightly forward** to maintain uptime

> Tanks should break left/right to prep for auto attack bait positioning

### Trinity

Following Exaflareâ€™s Edge:
- First **Trinity auto** is baited by **Melee DPS 1**
- Second **Trinity auto** is baited by **Melee DPS 2**

> Tanks must swap after the second auto to reset vulnerability stacks. 

## Akh Mornâ€™s Edge
{/* todo: Images */}
**Thordan spawns 3 towers**, always relative to his facing:
- 1 behind him (rear)
- 1 front-left
- 1 front-right

Like all Edge mechanics, Akh Morn begins with a **sword glow**:

- ðŸ”µ **Blue sword (Ice)** = Donut AoE â†’ Start **in**
- ðŸ”´ **Red sword (Flame)** = Point-blank AoE â†’ Start **out**

Each tower hits **multiple times** and must be soaked correctly or the party will wipe.

### Strategy

**Tower hits increase with each repetition**:  
- 5 hits (first Akh Morn)  
- 6 hits (second)  
- 7 hits (third)
{/* todo: Images */}
**First Akh Morn (3/3/2 Method)**:
- **Tank**: Rear tower
- **Group 1**: Left tower
- **Group 2**: Right tower

**Later Akh Morns (6/1/1 Method)**:
- **One tank**: Invulns rear tower
- **Other tank**: Right Tower
- **Remaining 6 players**: Left Tower

> Do not leave your tower earlyâ€”missing even one hit causes massive raidwide damage.

### Trinity

After the towers resolve:
- First **Trinity auto** is baited by **Ranged DPS 1**
- Second **Trinity auto** is baited by **Ranged DPS 2**

> Tanks must swap after the second auto to reset vulnerability stacks. 

## Gigaflareâ€™s Edge
{/* todo: Images */}
As always, this mechanic begins with a **sword glow**:

- ðŸ”µ **Blue sword (Ice)** = Donut AoE â†’ Move **in**
- ðŸ”´ **Red sword (Flame)** = Point-blank AoE â†’ Move **out**

### Strategy

1. **Gigaflare marker 1** spawns  
   â†’ At the same time, **Thordanâ€™s sword begins glowing** (In/Out preview only)
   â†’ Be opposite of it

2. **Gigaflare marker 2** spawns  
   â†’ Use this to determine the **rotation direction** (clockwise or counterclockwise)

3. **Gigaflare marker 3** spawns  
   â†’ All three positions are set â€” move **opposite the second** and prep for In/Out

4. **Gigaflare cast finishes**  
   â†’ The **sword AoE** and **Gigaflare 1** explode **together**

5. **Gigaflare 2** explodes  
   â†’ Rotate opposite its position

6. **Gigaflare 3** explodes  
   â†’ Final movement

> This combo layers an **In/Out ** with **three rotating proximity blasts**. Stay calm and rotate steadilyâ€”thereâ€™s plenty of room as long as you donâ€™t panic or cut diagonals.
> Melee can hover near max range to maintain uptime while rotating.

### Trinity

Following Gigaflareâ€™s Edge:
- First **Trinity auto** is baited by **Healer 1**
- Second **Trinity auto** is baited by **Healer 2**

> Tanks must swap after the second auto to reset vulnerability stacks. 

## Morn Afahâ€™s Edge (Enrage)

The final mechanic of the fight is **Morn Afahâ€™s Edge**, Thordanâ€™s enrage.

- Three massive **yellow towers** spawn around the boss in sequence.
- Each tower **must be soaked** by one player. Failing to soak a tower results in **instant raid wipe**.
- However, **any player standing inside** a tower when it resolves will **die**.

Since the towers are lethal by design, this mechanic is about **sacrificing players in a specific order** to buy time to kill Thordan.

### Strategy

To maximize DPS uptime:

- **First set of towers** â†’ Soaked by both **Healers** and the **Main Tank**
- **Second set of towers** â†’ Soaked by both **Ranged DPS** and the **Off Tank**
- **Third set of towers** â†’ **No one soaks** (let them explode)

> This gives **Melee DPS** the maximum uptime window for LB3 and final damage pushes.

### Final Push

- If **Limit Break 3** hasn't been used by this point, a **Melee DPS** should use it at the **start of "Morn Afahâ€™s Edge"**.
- This ensures maximum value during the final burst window.

>  If Thordan isnâ€™t killed before the third tower set finishes resolving, the fight will end in a **full-party wipe**.
