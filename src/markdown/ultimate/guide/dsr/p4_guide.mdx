# [P4: The Eyes](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=613699253336171&preview=1#)

{/* todo: Images */}
{/* fix: Rewrite some stuff */}
The arena will transition to Phase 4 after **Nidhogg** is defeated. This part of the guide follows the
[DSR Phase 4 - Eyes Toolbox](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=613699253336171&preview=1#).

At the start of this phase, everyone should stack on the **1 marker** to receive buffs from **Alphinaud**
and someone who will be randomly targeted for **"Soul of Friendship"**. These buffs will be required to
do damage during this phase.

{/* todo: Explain Each buffs what they do */}
{/* todo: Simplify */}

Throughout this phase, players will be fighting the **Eyes of Nidhogg** that appear on the west and east
sides of the arena:

- **Blue Eye**: Always positioned west
- **Red Eye**: Always positioned east
  {/* todo: Left/Right */}

## Initial Positioning

DPS should initially attack the **Blue Eye** while supports focus on the **Red Eye**. Tanks need to
establish aggro on both eyes as they perform auto-attacks throughout the phase. Ensure at least one
tank secures aggro on the **Blue Eye**.
{/* todo: OT/MT attribution ? */}

Shortly after receiving the buffs, **"Resentment"** will be cast, which is a raidwide AoE that applies
a bleed effect.
{/* todo: No Cast Bar */}

## Hatebound

Once the bleed effect expires, **"Hatebound"** will be cast. This mechanic tethers 4 players with blue
tethers and 4 players with red tethers. These tethers can be passed by standing on another player,
similar to mechanics like Rot, Nisi, or the role call debuff in P4S.

Ideal tether assignments: {/* todo: Reword */}

- **Melee and Tanks**: Should have Red tethers
- **Ranged and Healers**: Should have Blue tethers

> If you have the wrong color tether, stack on **Estinien** in the middle of the arena to pass it.
> {/* todo: Rem quote + Specify */}

Once you have the correct tether, move to your predetermined position:

- **Melee/Tanks**: Position in front of YELLOW orbs
  - DPS west, Supports east
- **Ranged/Healers**: Position in front of BLUE orbs
  - DPS west, Supports east
- **Group 1**: North side
- **Group 2**: South side
  {/* fix: fix chronogical order */}

## Blue and Yellow Orbs

As orbs grow for the first time, melee and tanks will pop their yellow orbs. After popping, they will
pass their tethers to the ranged and healers: {/* todo: rewrite */}

- **Group 1**: Pass tethers on the north side
- **Group 2**: Pass tethers on the south side
  {/* todo: explain dodge */}
  Once the tethers are swapped, melee and tanks can move to the **Blue Eye**, being careful to stay away
  from the orbs on the north and south.

As the blue orbs grow again, Ranged and Healers will pop their orbs, then move west to the **Blue Eye**.
These players, that have red tethers, will form a box formation standing max melee at the intercardinals of it.
Healers on the east side, Ranged on the west side.
The tanks and melee DPS that have blue tethers stack directly on the eye. {/* todo: those with blue tethers */}

For the next mechanic, you should aim to have the **Red Eye** at approximately 40% HP, as the upcoming mechanic
will deal 40% of its HP in damage.

## Mirage Dives

As the phase progresses, players with the red tether will begin receiving **"Mirage Dives**".
There will be 3 sets of 2 dives each:

- 2 Players with the Red debuff will be targeted with small-AoE dives
- 2 Players with the Blue debuff must approach the dive-targeted players and swap debuffs/positions with them
  {/* todo: based on prio and turn */}

> **Note**: The **Red Eye** takes damage each time a player with a red debuff (those targeted by dives)
> takes damage. The tether passes can be finicky, so the person who just took the dive should wait until
> the tether is passed before moving to the middle.

Swap order: Tanks → Melee → First divers
{/* fix: fix chronogical order */}
To determine who to swap with, we use a "snake" priority system based on your light party:

- **Group 1 Swaps**: Northwest, moving counterclockwise
- **Group 2 Swaps**: Northeast, moving clockwise

After the 3rd dive, those who were hit by the first dive must go back out and swap with those who were
just hit. Priorities are as follows:

- Counterclockwise most 1st dive: Northwest, moving counterclockwise
- Clockwise most 1st dive: Northeast, moving clockwise

After the 4th dive, players may move freely.

## Enrage

Both Eyes will begin casting a raidwide AoE **"Steep In Rage"**. Healers should ensure all DPS are at
full HP. At least one eye must die before this cast completes, or the damage will be lethal without
heavy mitigation. {/* todo: If both are alive */}

If both eyes are defeated before **"Nidhogg's Influence**" reaches 100, you will see a cutscene transitioning
back to the first phase, leading into the Rewind mechanic.

## Intermission: Rewind

{/* TODO: Add images for Planar layout, LB3 timing, and AoE baiting */}

This brief intermission mirrors the **Planar Prison** sequence from Phase 1, but with one crucial difference:  
you must _successfully_ **save Haurchefant** to proceed.

### Saving Haurchefant

Shortly into the phase (about 3 GCDs), **Haurchefant** will appear to block the **Spear of the Fury**.  
To protect him, a **Tank must use Limit Break 3** as soon as he lands.

- While LB3 is active, Haurchefant takes heavily reduced damage
- Healers must spot-heal him continuously to keep him alive
- Failing to keep Haurchefant alive will cause a loop to **Phase 1**

> If LB3 is delayed, **Pure of Heart** will kill Haurchefant and the party will wipe.

### Key Mechanics

- **Shockwave** – Constant raid-wide damage pulsing from Haurchefant as long as he's alive
- **Brightwing** – Cast by **Charibert**, cleaves the two closest players with high damage conal AoEs, applying:
  - **Light Resistance Down**
  - **Skyblind**, which drops an invisible AoE under the target's position after 5s and explodes shortly after

- **Pure of Heart** – A long cast by Charibert.  
  Deals raid-wide damage based on **his remaining HP**. If he is above ~30% at the end of the cast, it will wipe the party.  
  Also hits **Haurchefant**, so he must be healed to near full HP.

### Final Check: Spear of the Fury

After **Pure of Heart** resolves, the **Planar Prison** fades.  
**The Spear of the Fury** becomes targetable and starts casting **Pierce**, an enrage that kills Haurchefant.

- Quickly stack on Haurchefant and **burst the spear** before the cast completes
- If the spear finishes casting, you will **return to Phase 2**

> If executed properly, Haurchefant survives, and the party proceeds to **Phase 5** after a short cutscene.
