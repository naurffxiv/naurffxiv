# [P3: Nidhogg](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=267799249146271&preview=1#)

{/* todo: Images */}
Once **Thordan** is defeated, the arena transitions into Phase 3, starting with a massive raid-wide AoE,
**"Final Chorus"**, from **Nidhogg** as he descends.

He will begin auto-attacking the main tank three times with cleaving line AoEs.
The tank should face the boss north at the A marker. **Nidhogg** will then cast
**"Dive from Grace"** aka _Wyrmhole_.

As **Nidhogg** finishes casts, each player is assigned a **numbered debuff** (1-3) determining the order
in which **Nidhogg's clone** will target them for a dive attack. Players are divided into:

- Three **"First in Line"** (I) debuffs
- Two **"Second in Line"** (II) debuffs
- Three **"Third in Line"** (III) debuffs

Each dive will spawn a tower 3 seconds after hitting the player, which must be soaked by another player.
A **Nidstinien clone** will appear at the tower's location, locking onto the closest player.
The soaker must face the clone away from the party to avoid cleaving others.

## Tower Placement & Arrows

Before the dives resolve, some players will receive an arrow debuff or no debuff, affecting where their
tower will spawn.

- **Up arrow** (**"Spineshatter Dive Target"**) → Tower spawns **in front** of the player.
- **Down arrow** (**"Elusive Jump Target"**) → Tower spawns **behind** the player.
- **No arrow** (**"High Jump Target"**) → Tower spawns **directly on** the player.

To simplify, follow the **Westhogg strategy**:

- **Arrow debuff** → Always face **west** before getting hit, ensuring towers spawn in predictable spots.

## Pre-Positioning

Before the mechanic resolves, players should claim spots:

- **(I)** players take the east/south/west spots.
- **(II)** players take the north-west/north-east spots.
- **(III)** players take the east/south/west spots.

Players assigned arrows should follow the following positioning: **down arrows** always take **west**,
**up arrows** take **east**, and **no arrows** take the **south** spot.

The dive and tower soak pattern follows a set order:

1. First set: (I) get hit, (III) soak towers.
2. Second set: (II) get hit, (I) east/west soak towers.
3. Third set: (III) get hit, (II) soak towers, and (I) soaks the south tower.

After the debuffs are applied, **Nidhogg** will begin casting **"Gnash and Lash"** or **"Lash and Gnash"**,
determining the in/out AoE pattern for the upcoming mechanic.

- "**Gnash**" = Out
- "**Lash**" = In

He will cast this mechanic twice during the phase. The pattern is not guaranteed to be reversed,
so players need to track the order for later mechanics. The first cast will happen during the
**First** (I) and **Third** (III) tower placements.

## Wyrmhole

### First Stack

The party should stack on the boss's hitbox to soak the **"Eye of the Tyrant"**, which deals heavy
stack damage. Meanwhile, **(I)** players should position themselves at the edge of the hitbox to
prepare for tower placements.

> **Important**: Be mindful of **"Gnash and Lash"** timing, as it has a delayed execution after the cast bar.
> Always watch for the visual cue of **Nidhogg's** wings to know when to move.

Once a group is hit by the clones, they will lose their debuff and gain **"Fire Vulnerability"**,
preventing them from soaking the next set of towers.

As the **(III)** group moves into position to soak the towers that **(I)** previously placed,
**Nidhogg** will cast the second portion of **"Gnash and Lash"** again, with the order of the
attacks reversed.

After the towers are soaked, **Nidhogg's clones** will spawn at the soaked locations. They will
lock onto the closest player, and players must bait the clones' line AoEs towards the wall. Be sure
to dodge the second part of **"Gnash and Lash"** before the clones resolve.

While **(III)** are baiting the line AoEs, **(II)** should place their towers at max melee range
to the northeast and northwest, following their assigned arrows. At this point, **(III)** should
be preparing to drop their towers.

Once **(II)** has placed their towers, **(I)** who soaked the east and west towers should move to
soak the second set of east and west towers. After soaking, bait the clones outside towards the wall.
After baiting clones, **(I)** should swiftly move for the next stack.

### Second Stack

A total of 5 players—the **2 (I) players** who soaked the northeast and northwest towers, the
**south (I)** who hasn't soaked a tower yet, and the **2 (II) players** who placed their towers—should
stack north on the boss's hitbox to take the second **"Eye of the Tyrant"**. **Nidhogg** will then
cast **"Gnash and Lash"** again.

After dodging the second part of **"Gnash and Lash"**, the **(II)** and **(I)** players who have not
yet soaked a tower will move to handle the **(III)** dropped towers and bait the Nidhogg clones one
last time. Meanwhile, the party should focus on resolving both parts of **"Gnash and Lash"** accordingly.

## Drachenlance

After all the clones are baited, the main tank must move away from the party to avoid cleaving auto-attacks.
The tank can either stand in front of where they last took their tower or move to an intercardinal position.

Two cleaving tank AA attacks will follow. Afterward, **Nidhogg** will face a random player and cast
**"Drachenlance"**, a 90-degree frontal cleave. Simply move away from the cleave before the cast ends.

Once **Drachenlance** is done, move with your meteor partner to the clockwise intercardinal from your
meteor position to prepare for tower soaks. One tower will spawn at each intercardinal, requiring 1-4
players to soak.

## Darkdragon Dive (Enumeration)

All eight players must be assigned to soak a tower. If a tank or melee's default tower requires only one player,
they must adjust by checking **clockwise**, then **counterclockwise**, and finally diagonally for a tower
that requires 3 or 4 soakers.

Three of the towers will spawn **Nidhogg clones**, which will lock onto the nearest player.
Ranged players should position themselves at the center of the tower to ensure the clones face them
and point them outward to avoid overlap. The clones will cast a line AoE, so after baiting them,
the party should collapse onto the **east** and **west** markers to prevent cleaving and create space
for **"Soul Tether"**.

## Soul Tether

One tower and the boss will **"Soul Tether"** to random players. Tanks should follow the
[mitigation sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YJX933Fe6MeNv06QVQfRUI3oJVfCvm4OqOyLCSjcAJk/edit?usp=sharing)
to handle this mechanic. If tethered to a tower, collapse east or west to ensure the tank can easily grab the tether.

> Tethers are the hardest hit in all of DSR and require comprehensive mitigation from tanks, as well as
> external cooldowns from healers. Tanks may also invuln the tethers to reduce the damage.

Tanks can safely resolve tethers in the following positions:

1. Under the boss (invuln if stacking together),
2. Under the tower that extended the tether (the size of the AoE is exactly the size of the base of the tower),
3. Directly north or south.

Once the clones and **"Soul Tether"** are dealt with, cleaving auto-attacks will resume, followed by one
final **"Drachenlance"**. If **Nidhogg** reaches 8% HP or lower before enrage, players should clear the
phase and move on to Phase 4.
