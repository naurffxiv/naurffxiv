# P5: King Thordan II

{/* todo: Images */}
Phase 5 begins with **King Thordan** returning from Phase 2, now empowered and corrupted.
He spawns in the center of the arena, facing south, and immediately performs two cleaving auto-attacks.

> The main tank should keep the boss facing south for this part, being careful not to cleave the party.

After the auto-attacks, **Thordan** begins casting **Wrath of the Heavens**, initiating the first major mechanic of the phase.

## [Wrath of the Heavens (Wrath)](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=514795714993271&preview=1)

When **Wrath of the Heavens** begins, position at the center of the arena to prepare for movement. Multiple enemies will appear:

- Two **Dragoons**
- A **White Dragon**
- Two large dragons (appear later)
- A **Warrior** and a **Mage** (spawned near the end)
  {/* todo: Most likely will rewrite this section */}
  > Treat the **Dragon** and the two **Dragoons** as **relative north** for this mechanic. The later will spawn at the intercardinals closest to it (northwest and northeast if White Dragon is North).

### Initial Mechanics

As the phase begins, the following will happen:

1. **Tethers (Dragoon Dives)**  
   Each **Dragoon** will tether one player. These tethers will resolve as dashes when the dragons dive, dealing damage and applying **Magic Vulnerability Up** to the targets. Tethered players must dodge to avoid being hit directly.

2. **Skyward Leap (Defamation)**  
   One random player will be marked by **Skyward Leap**, a large blue AoE indicator (**Defamation**). This player must spread far from the group to avoid shared damage.

3. **Lightnings**  
   Two random players will be marked with a **Thunderstruck** debuff. When the debuff expires later, it will hit the player with a lightning puddle that stuns and damages anyone nearby.

4. **Twisters**  
   All players will be targeted with **Twisters**, invisible traps placed directly under their feet.

   > A **Twister** is a proximity-based AoE that triggers if stepped on or moved through. When triggered, it knocks back and kills nearby players.  
   > **Important**: Twisters snapshot when the **animation** begins—not when the cast bar ends. Movement must be precisely timed.

> All of the above—**Dragoons' tethers**, **Defamation**, and the **Twister dive**—will resolve **simultaneously** when the dragon dives across the middle of the arena.  
> The **Lightnings** are delayed and will resolve later, during the safe zone portion of the mechanic.

### Pre-Dive Positioning and Dodge

{/* todo: Image pre dive */}

- **Unmarked players**: Spread to the **east side** of the Dragoons. Maintain spacing to avoid
  the **"Twisters"** that will drop beneath you.

- **Tethered players**: Stand **directly opposite** your tethered **Dragoon**, using arena lines or **4 notches from the intercardinal** on the wall for alignment.

- **Defamation**: Stand **4 notches northwest** (relative to the Twister Dragon) to safely isolate your AoE

Just before the dives resolve, two players will be marked with **Lightning Chains** (a buff that later explodes). These players should take note—they’ll need to spread out after the next mechanic.

When the dragons dive and tethers activate, dodge toward the middle to avoid **"Twisters"** or you will be killed. {/* todo specify following the lines on the floor, stay in your lanes */}
The tethered players and defamation player should move toward the west side of the arena in preparation for
the next mechanic.

### Divebombs & Proteans

{/* todo: Image post-twisters */}
Once the dragons dive and the tethers resolve, dodge toward the center to avoid the **Twisters**. While dodging, mainting your lines on the floor, treat them as lanes for yourself.

One player will be marked with a green circle **divebomb marker**. This marker disappears after a delay and shows where dragons outside the arena will dive.
{/* todo: custom debuff divebomb; explaining target will be charged by a dragon, Line AoE Damage and Knockback */}

- The divebomb marker player should move to the **wall behind the Mage**, opposite of the **Warrior** (south).
- At the same time, **Thordan** appears and casts a set of unavoidable **Protean AoEs** on the party.

> Overlapping these **Proteans** is lethal. Spread out approximately three to four tiles wide, while avoiding leftover Twisters.

- **Tethered and defamation players**: Move west.
- **Unmarked players**: Stay east (except for the divebomb marker, who stays south).

### Targeted AoEs

Two players will now be targeted with AoEs based on whether or not they had earlier mechanics:

1. **Altar Flare**: Targets a player who previously had a Tether, Defamation, or Divebomb. Drops **4 delayed AoEs ("Eruptions")**.
2. **Liquid Heaven**: Targets a player who had **no previous mechanic**. Drops **5 fast AoEs**, one after another. Do not stagger these too much.

> These AoEs deal moderate damage. Both should be baited **away from the Warrior and the rest of the party**.
> Make sure to bait puddles in a way that won't block off movement for anyone trying to get to the Warrior.

- After dropping their puddles, affected players should **loop back under the Warrior**.
- All other players should stay **south of the Warrior** to avoid Lightning AoEs.

> If the Warrior spawns near you, be sure to bait the AoEs elsewhere—never drop them in the safe zone.

### Warrior Safe Spot

After the Proteans and the divebomb marker disappears, the arena becomes dangerous except for the area under the **Warrior**.

> Treat the **Warrior’s position as relative north** for the rest of the mechanic.

The entire party should stack under the **Warrior**. Meanwhile:

- **Lightning-marked players** spread **north of the Warrior**, staying apart.
- Use the **inner ring** on the ground as a visual guide to avoid overlapping each other's AoEs.

> When the **Lightning Chain** expires, it will stun and damage anyone caught in the AoE.
> {/* todo: Image safespot Warrior */}

### Ancient Quaga 1

After all mechanics resolve successfully, **Thordan** will cast **"Ancient Quaga"** (as seen in Phase 2),
followed by one auto-attack and a double tank buster:

1. **"Heavenly Heel"**: Applies **Slashing Resistance Down**, making the target vulnerable to follow-up attacks.
2. **"Ascalon's Might"**: A powerful hit that must be invulned or tank-swapped due to the debuff applied.

Depending on your tank composition, these busters should be mitigated or invulned. Refer to the mitigation sheet for specific details.

Once the tank busters are finished, **Thordan** will begin casting **"Death of the Heavens"**, the second major mechanic of this phase.

## [Death of the Heavens (DotH)](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=414790163993271&preview=1#)

At the end of his cast, **Thordan** jumps away. **Grinnaux** (the Warrior) will spawn at a **random cardinal**, establishing your new **relative north** for the remainder of the mechanic.

Shortly after the **Warrior** spawns:

- **Four random players** will be inflicted with **Doom**, indicated by a red visual effect and party list debuff.
- The remaining **four non-doom players** will eventually drop **cleansing puddles**, which remove the Doom debuff when a doomed player is knocked into them.

Enemy placements are as follows:

- One **dragon** will appear at true north or south.
- Another **dragon** and a **knight** will appear near east or west **intercardinals**.
- These enemies will prepare massive **line AoEs**, carving out narrow safe zones.

### Doom Mechanics

To prepare, the party should form a **conga line** facing the **Warrior**, evenly spaced:

{/* todo: Image */}

- **Non-doomed players** will drop the puddles used for cleansing.
- **Doomed players** will later be knocked into these puddles during chain resolution.

### Safe Spot Positioning

The safe spots for the first part of this mechanic are as follows:

- **Two large safe zones** near the **East and West cardinals**
- **Two smaller safe spots** slightly **north or south of the intercardinals**

Position according to your **Doom status** and role:
{/* todo: Image Doom assignments */}
| Role | Position |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Outer Dooms** | Inside the safe zone at **East or West**, on the **grey tile ring** |
| **Inner Dooms** | Slightly inside the **northern intercardinals**, one notch in from the edge |
| **Outer Non-Dooms**| At the **East or West walls**, aligned with the cardinal marker |
| **Inner Non-Dooms**| Slightly inside the **southern intercardinals**, one notch in from the edge |

> Tip: Use the arena’s notches and tile markings to align precisely. Small missteps here can cause Twister or Lightning overlaps.

### Mechanic Resolution

Following the Doom assignment:

- **Lightning Storm** targets all players with small AoEs that inflict **Lightning Resistance Down II**. Spread out—overlapping is lethal.
- **Twisters** are dropped beneath each player. These snapshot on animation and will kill nearby players if triggered.
- **Grinnaux** casts **Heavy Impact**, a large point-blank Earthquake AoE.

> **Twisters** resolve **when the dive happens**, not when the cast bar ends. Movement must be timed precisely to avoid triggering them.

> **Thordan** and **The Eye** will return from Phase 2. Note their positions outside the arena as they will cast a gaze attack.

To resolve this mechanic:
{/* todo: Image Earthquake dodge */}

1. **1st Heavy Impact (Earthquake)** goes off—**do not move yet**.
2. Immediately after, the following resolve **simultaneously**:
   - **2nd Heavy Impact (Earthquake)**, doom players move towards the Warrior.
   - **Divebombs** from dragons and the Dragoon knight
   - **Lightning Storm** and **Twisters**, non dooms move away from the Earthquake.
   - **Line AoEs** cleaving the arena
3. **3rd Heavy Impact (Earthquake)** goes off, non-dooms move into the next AoE.

> Move once lightning hits. It marks the safest time to dodge Twisters.

### PlayStation Markers & Chains

{/* TODO: Image - Doom marker positioning */}

Once everyone has regrouped in the center, the next sequence begins:  
a **knockback**, similar to Phase 1, layered with **chains** and **PlayStation markers**.

Every player must:

- **Break their chain** by reaching the wall
- **Resolve their PlayStation marker** safely
- **Cleanse Doom** by landing in a puddle if afflicted

**Doomed players** will receive:

- **Circle** – Always assigned to the **two furthest players**, baited intentionally by **outer Dooms** (typically East and West)
- **Square/Triangle** – Assigned to the **inner Dooms**, who must anchor **Southeast and Southwest** relative to the Warrior

> The rest of the party should remain closer to center to avoid accidentally baiting unwanted markers.

**Non-doomed players** will receive:

- **Cross** – will aways be **North and South**. These can be **pre-positioned** ahead of time
- **Square/Triangle** – should position opposite to their doomed partners who are already
  anchored in position

> Correct positioning ensures clean knockbacks, safe AoEs, and proper Doom cleanses.

As knockback resolves, **Thordan** and **The Eye** will appear outside the arena and cast a **gaze attack**.  
All players must **face away** during the knockback to avoid being stunned.

### Knockback Resolution

{/* TODO: Image - Gaze + PlayStation markers + Knockback Positioning */}

As everyone prepares for knockback, **face away from Thordan and The Eye**, who will cast a gaze attack (same as Phase 2).  
Each player is knocked back to either a cardinal or intercardinal position based on their marker setup.

- **Doomed players** must land in the puddles dropped earlier to cleanse.
- **Everyone** must reach the wall to break their chains and avoid overlapping AoEs.

> Failure to reach your assigned position or cleanse Doom will result in deaths.

{/* TODO: Image - Limit Break 2 Meteor Targets */}

After knockback resolves, **8 meteors** spawn around the edge of the arena.  
These meteors must be destroyed **before hitting the ground**, or the raid will wipe instantly.

- Use **Caster Limit Break 2** on 3 meteors—typically those around **True North** (A marker).
- If your caster is dead, a **Physical Ranged LB2** can substitute in an emergency.

Each player should focus on the meteor closest to where they were knocked back.  
Ignore the LB targets to ensure even damage distribution.

## Ancient Quaga 2

After all mechanics resolve successfully, **Thordan** will return to the arena and cast **Ancient Quaga**, a raid-wide AoE seen previously in Phase 2.

He will then follow up with:

1. **Heavenly Heel** – Applies **Slashing Resistance Down**, making the target vulnerable to follow-up attacks.
2. **Ascalon’s Might** – A powerful multi-hit tankbuster that **must be invulned or tank-swapped** due to the resistance debuff.

This combo is followed by one final **auto-attack** before **Thordan** begins his enrage cast.

> Depending on your tank composition, this sequence should be **invulned**, **mitigated**, or **swapped**.  
> Refer to the **tank mitigation sheet** for specific assignments.

**Healers** should be ready for heavy tank damage during this window.

> **Important**: Do not kill Thordan.
> Reduce him to approximately **2% HP**, then stop DPS immediately.

If he is killed fully, the party will **wipe during Phase 7**.  
Sparing him causes him to jump away, allowing the encounter to continue.
