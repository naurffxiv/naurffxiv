# [P1: Adelphel, Grinnaux and Charibert](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=802461081524561&preview=1#1)

{/* todo: Images */}

Phase 1 features **Ser Adelphel** (Paladin), **Ser Grinnaux** (Warrior), and **Ser Charibert** (Black Mage).
Only **Ser Adelphel** and **Ser Grinnaux** are initially targetable.

Notes before pulling:

1. Decide tank assignments. Each tank typically handles their assigned boss's tank busters.
2. Plan tank mitigation for the bosses' auto attacks. Note that Grinnaux's autos hit harder than Adelphel's.
3. Be sure to interrupt Adelphel's "**Holiest Hallowing**" cast (occurs three times).

   > This cast must be interrupted or the bosses will be healed, making the phase impossible.

Order of interrupts is: Adelphel Tank > Phys. Ranged > Adelphel Tank.

Pull both bosses center and focus DPS on Adelphel. The phase begins with "**Holiest of Holy**",
a heavy-hitting raidwide. Afterward, **Ser Adelphel** spawns a tether on a random player,
consisting of two tank busters: "**Holy Shield Bash**" and "**Holy Bladedance**".

The tank who has aggro of him will take this tether north using invulnerability while the party
stacks south to avoid cleave damage. A few moments after the tether spawns, both **Ser Grinnaux**
and **Ser Charibert** will cast mechanics of their own as the tether resolves.

**Ser Grinnaux's** cast is "**Empty Dimension**". This is a donut AoE that originates from him.
The party will need to make sure to be close to him.

**Ser Charibert's** cast is "**Heavensblaze**". This is a small AoE that will target a random party member.
The more players that stand in the AoE, the less damage it will do so the party should be stacked.

## Hyperdimensional Slashes

{/* todo: Images */}
After the tank buster and AoEs, **Ser Adelphel** jumps to the arena's side becoming immune to damage while
**Ser Grinnaux** dashes center for two sets of "**Hyperdimensional Slashes**".
Four random party members will be marked with orange markers above their player model while four
others will remain unmarked.

The markers signify party members that are being targeted for a "**Hyperdimensional Slash**".
These slashes fire a line AoE in the direction of the marked party members.
The line AoE will also drop a "**Portal**" at the end of the line AoE.

> If these "**Portals**" are too close to one another or if a party member gets too close to them,
> they will explode and deal damage to the party. This will also apply a "**Damage Down**" debuff
> to the players hit by the explosion.

The four marked party members will need to spread in a way to avoid clipping other party members
and place the "**Portals**" far enough away from each other. To avoid clipping the unmarked players,
the first set of slashes will be taken on the north side of the arena. If the party is using the markers
from the DSR resource page, they are placed precisely so you can stand in the middle of them to avoid
the other marked players.

> There is no priority for spread positions. Try to preposition to where you want to go to avoid confusion.

The party members who are not targeted for slashes will need to stack south on the tip of the middle
diamond to bait a conal, shared AoE from **Ser Grinnaux**. One party member who is not marked is randomly
chosen to be the target of the shared AoE.

Both the line AoEs and the shared AoE will go off at the same time. As both initial mechanics resolve,
the unmarked party members will now be marked and the marked players will no longer be marked.
The new marked players will need to spread on the south side of the arena just as the other players
did on the north side while the north side stacks to share the conal AoE.

> To make the south spreads a bit easier, you can slightly preposition to the marker you want to go to
> when sharing the previous stack.

## Ser Adelphel Dashes

{/* todo: Images */}
After the second set of "**Hyperdimensional Slashes**", **Ser Adelphel** will jump to a random cardinal
direction starting the next mechanic.

The party should position opposite of **Ser Adelphel** and prepare for a knockback from **Ser Grinnaux**:
**Faith Unmoving**. The party should use KB prevention to avoid being knocked into the wall or the
**"Portals"**. **Ser Grinnaux** will also cast another "**Holiest of Holy**" raidwide as the knockback goes off.

After the knockback, **Ser Adelphel** will dash around the arena in an hourglass formation dropping
"**Bright Flare**" orbs as he dashes. These orbs will explode after a short time.
The first dash will always be to a cardinal direction left or right of him.

To avoid the exploding orbs and his dashes, the party will need to move in the direction where he
initially dashes to. While moving in that direction, the party should be aiming for the green,
triangle-shaped marking on the floor at one of the intercardinal directions.

> Be sure not to be too far out or too far in while moving. The "**Portals**" can still explode if
> someone is too close, or you can get hit by the dash and orbs from **Ser Adelphel**.

Once **Ser Adelphel** finishes his dashes, he will follow up with a tank buster on whoever has
aggro of him. This tank buster knocks anyone back into the wall of death who is near the tank
taking the tank buster. The tank with **Ser Adelphel** should move away from the party as the
last dashes go off to avoid sending anyone into the wall.

When the dashes and tank buster have resolved, **Ser Adelphel** will attempt to cast
"**Holiest Hallowing**" that should be interrupted by the tank with aggro. The other tank
can interrupt if the tank with aggro is unable to.

## PlayStation Markers and Chains

{/* todo: Images */}
Take both bosses to the center of the room and prepare for the next mechanic.
Tanks will need to make sure that the bosses are centered as much as possible, especially **Ser Grinnaux**.

Every party member will be marked with a PlayStation marker above their head and be chained to
a party member with the same marker.

- **Tanks**: Can receive Blue "X" or Purple Square.
- **Healers**: Can receive a Blue "X" or Green Triangle.
- **DPS**: Can receive a Red Circle, Purple Square, or Green Triangle.

> The chains need to be broken before they expire or they will one-shot the players.
> Tanks can survive but receive damage down.

Before chains and markers are applied, the party should try to be as close to the center of the
arena as possible. The closer the party is to their partner when the chain is applied, the easier
it will be to break the chain.

A couple moments after the markers are applied, **Ser Grinnaux** will cast another "**Faith Unmoving**"
knockback. Shortly after the knockback, **Ser Charibert** will cast an AoE on each party member.

To resolve the mechanic, a couple steps must be followed:

1. Move to the middle of the arena and prepare to be chained and marked.

2. Move to assigned position once marked and prepare for knockback.

As stated above, only certain roles will get certain markers. Each marker has a predetermined position
that is role dependent:
{/* todo: Look at maybe redoing this section with images or markdown */}
Blue "X" Positions

- Tank - North
- Healer - South

Green Triangle Positions

- DPS - North West
- Healer - South East

Purple Square Positions

- Tank - North East
- DPS - South West

Red Circle Positions

- Red Circle DPS Furthest West - West
- Red Circle DPS Furthest East - East

These positions ensure that your partner will always be across from you during the knockback to break the chain.

3. Prepare for the knockback from **Ser Grinnaux**.

> If positioned correctly, the knockback will send you to the edge of the arena, breaking the chain.
> Make sure to not be far out and inline with **Ser Grinnaux**. If not properly positioned with him,
> you may get knocked back towards another player. It is common for tanks to not have him properly
> positioned so adjust as needed.

Warriors should note that Inner Release knockback prevention will prevent them from being knocked back
if the buff is active.

4. Adjust position to avoid the AoE from **Ser Charibert** and prepare for the next mechanic.

As players are knocked back, the spread AoE will go off on each party member. If positioned correctly,
the players should be in position to take their AoE. Make sure to be close to the wall and adjust away
from players to avoid overlapping.

Tanks should bring the bosses back to the center of the room after resolving the PlayStation Markers,
chains, and spreads.

The party will need to group up for heals and keep the bosses around the same HP. Another
"**Holiest Hallowing**" will be cast which needs to be interrupted by the Phys. Ranged.

> If the Phys. Ranged is unable to interrupt, the **Ser Grinnaux** tank can interrupt if they have not already.

After the interrupt, **Ser Adelphel** will cast another "**Holiest of Holy**" raidwide while
**Ser Grinnaux** will cast a "**Full Dimension**" or "**Empty Dimension**" AoE. This is the same mechanic
at the start of the phase but it can either be a donut or point-blank AoE. Full is out, Empty is in.
After the raidwide, yet another "**Holiest Hallowing**" will be cast which needs to be interrupted by the Tank.
A final "**Holiest of Holy**" will be cast after the interrupt.

Finally, the "**The Bull's Steel**" will be cast. This is an enrage cast that gives them invulnerability,
damage buffs, and fully heals them, making the phase impossible to clear. Both bosses need to be defeated
at the same time or the one who did not die with the other will cast a quick enrage.

## Planar Prison

{/* todo: Images */}
Once both bosses are defeated, they jump to the west side of the arena along with **Ser Charibert**
to pull you into the center of a death wall. While in this "**Planar Prison**", all party members
will be chained to **Ser Grinnaux** and movement speed will be reduced.

"**Haurchefant**" will spawn outside the arena, blocking an incoming attack that will cause raid-wide
damage until he is killed. "**Haurchefant**" will also have a healing debuff called "**HP Recovery Down**",
preventing him from being healed.

Throughout this mechanic, **Ser Charibert** will be casting "**Pure of Heart**", which is the enrage cast.
To beat this enrage, you must get him below 30% before the cast is finished.

During this time, four sets of two conal AoEs will be triggered in succession, emanating from **Ser Charibert**.
These cones are baited and hit the two closest party members to him. Once a party member is hit, they will be
applied with a "**Light Resistance Down**" debuff and "**Skyblind**", a puddle debuff that will drop a puddle
under them once "**Skyblind**" expires.

To resolve this mechanic, two sets of party members need to bait the cones south, away from the party,
who should stack north of **Ser Charibert**. The bait order is: Healers > Melee > Ranged > Tanks

After a cone is baited, move to one side of the party to drop the puddle debuff. Healers and Ranged will
drop their puddles left of **Ser Charibert**, facing him. Melee and Tanks will drop their puddles right
of **Ser Charibert**, facing him. Tanks can alternatively drop the puddles where they took the bait as
they are the last ones.

Once all baits have been taken, the cast will finish, resulting in a raid-wide AoE. If **Ser Charibert**
reaches below 30%, you will continue on to the next phase. If not, the raid-wide will kill you, sending
you back to the start of the phase.

The arena will transition to Phase 2 and **King Thordan** will spawn. Make sure to tag and hit him.
Not doing so will send you back to Phase 1.
