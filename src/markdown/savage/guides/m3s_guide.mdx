## Repeat Mechanics

### Lariat

Glowing hands -> donut; non-glowing hands -> out.
    
The Quadroboom cones are very narrow, around 15 degrees. The Octoboom cones are about 45 degrees.
    
Spreads should be to clock spot directions. For pairs, supports rotate counterclockwise (CCW) onto the DPS with the same color waymark.
    
Lariats are always resolved using True North clock spots, even if the boss was not facing north after a prior mechanic.

### Dive

Glowing hands -> knockback (KB); non-glowing hands -> proximity AoE/away.
Knockback immunity (KBI) is recommended for maintaining melee uptime.

### Brutal Impact

Starts with 4 hits. Adds 2 additional hits for every stack of Doping Draught, in addition to the ~7 - 8% damage increase from Doping Draught.

### Knuckle Sandwich

Starts with 4 hits. Adds 2 additional hits for every stack of Doping Draught, in addition to the ~7 - 8% damage increase from Doping Draught.
    
After the second Draught, tanks use invulnerability skills (invulns) for the tank busters (TBs), with the main tank (MT) going first, 
followed by the off-tank (OT). Regular mitigations are used for auto-attacks throughout the rest of the fight. 

Hits are spread over 8 seconds, so precise timing on invulns is necessary.

Couple of tips:
- The first Lariat and Dive, before the first Draught, always follow the non-glowing hands pattern.
- The second Lariat and Dive, after the first Draught, always follow the glowing hands pattern.
- From the third time onward, any pattern can occur.
- "Octoboom" refers to spreads, while "Quadroboom" refers to pairs.

## Barrage

First towers spawn at opposite cardinals. Melee players take the North or West tower, and ranged players take the South or East tower. 
Group 1 rides the knockback to the left while facing the center, and Group 2 rides it to the right while facing the center.

Do not attempt to use knockback immunity unless the entire party plans to do so!

After riding to 2nd tower with your partner, take note where the boss teleported to. 
He will be in a random intercardinal at the wall. 

For 2nd tower, everyone rides to the middle for final tower. 
At the final tower, you need to aim yourself behind the boss as he is casting Murderous Mist which is a 270 degree cone to the arena in front of him. 
If you are hit you will have a damage down and poison debuff.

- Light Party 1 (left side) can use the arrow on the ring around the tower as a guide.
- Light Party 2 (right side) can use the start of the gap from the line at the top of the tower’s edge as a guide.
- Subsequent  towers you can just use the arrows on the ground.

## Chain Deathmatch 1

Players will be chained to one clone and will only see their own chain. 
Players must get hit by their clone's first attack but avoid the second one.

Clones always invert their cleave direction when bouncing off the ropes,
so the corner that is hit by both cleaves the first time will be safe for the second cleaves.
This is immediately followed by a Lariat.

Melees can maintain uptime standing at cardinal marker in front of their clone and just dodge appropriately to avoid the second clone. 
DM2 this isn’t a guarantee.

## Final Fusedown

Eight bombs spawn around the room; four have a short fuse and four have a long fuse. 
NE and SW fuses are always long; NW and SE fuses are always short. 
N+E fuses always match in duration (long or short), as do S+W.

All players receive a fuse, with one role getting a short fuse and the other role getting a long fuse. 
Short fuses spread first while long fuses stack near the center of the room, slightly toward the two cardinal bombs with long fuses. 
Both bomb and player short fuses detonate simultaneously, and the roles swap stack/spread positions.

* Group 1 R/H spreads to NE then NW; Group 2 R/H spreads to SW then SE.
* Group 1 M/T spreads to N or W; Group 2 M/T spreads to E or S.

Immediately followed by a Dive to a random cardinal.

Fusefield is boss acting damage. Addle/Rep/Feint all work for Fusefield (everything in fight except clone damage and fuses on heads are boss acting).

***

## Fusefield

Players receive a 26s (short) or 44s (long) Bombarium debuff; all DPS will have the same debuff duration, as will all Supports. 
If not cleansed with a fuse, the player will die.
Cleansing by stepping on a fuse removes both the fuse and the debuff and causes heavy raidwide damage with a 4-second magic vulnerability,
preventing rapid detonation.

Starting at North, M1 searches clockwise for the first short fuse (if the player's debuff is also short) and prepositions onto it. 
M2 finds the second short fuse, R1 finds the third, and R2 finds the fourth. 
There is no damage during this mechanic except from player fuse explosions, so M1 should step on their fuse as soon as possible.

Stepping on a fuse without a Bombarium debuff is lethal but will detonate the fuse and potentially prevent a wipe in unusual situations,
such as a recovery after a resurrection. Bombarium debuffs will expire well before the fuses reach the boss at the center,
so players (e.g., long R2) cannot wait for the burning fuse to reach them passively.
Fuse hit detection is also notoriously unreliable, so plan to move around on your burning fuse to ensure detonation.

This is one of the only sources of magic damage in the entire fight and by far the most important.
Player fuses are another source, as well as certain avoidable attacks.

## Bombarian Special

Before the mechanics starts, "Octoboom" or "Quadroboom" will be included in the initial cast bar indicating whether the ending will involve pairs or spreads.

This mechanic starts with 5 aoe hits, followed by a point blank aoe around the boss. 
After the point black AoE, he will follow up with a donut and 1 last AoE hit.
These AoE hits do a lot of damage so plan to mitigate and heal through it.

Once all AoEs are cast, a blue knock back marker spawn which can either be KBI or riden to the intercardinal.
Then you resolve spread/pairs. 

Total damage from this sequence is significantly higher than the Big Impact under 2x Doping Draught.

***

## Chain Deathmatch 2

Players will be chained to one clone and the boss and will only see their own chains. 
Players must get hit by their clone's first cleave and the boss's cast of Murderous Mist (at a random cardinal).

Clones always invert their cleave direction when bouncing off the ropes,
so the corner that is hit by both cleaves the first time will be safe for the second cleaves.

***

## Fuse or Foe

At the beginning of the mechanic, everyone will be targeted again with short or long fuses. 
These fuses can be ignored throughout the mechanic.
The boss will also telegraph a rotating, conal AoE, and two ground AoEs will appear on two intercards across from each other. 
Note: When these AoEs go off, they will expand into a donut AoE.

For the initial dodge, wait for the ground AoEs to appear, and follow the boss's spin normally while moving into the expanding AoEs.
When the boss has rotated 180 degrees, dodge into the middle of the arena behind the boss as the donuts will expand again.
The fuses will ignite towards the end of the boss's rotation, and another set of donuts will appear. 
Spread to your clock positions while dodging the AoEs.

To keep uptime, melee and healers swap clock positions for this mechanic.

The bombs will explode one after another. 
After each explosion, donut AoEs will continue to appear. 
Stay near your waymark and dodge into the safe spot. 
After the bombs conclude on both role groups, resolve protean or pairs with in or out mechanics.

### Barrage 2

Follow the strategy from Barrage 1, but instead of Murderous Mist,
the boss will run to a random cardinal and perform a 3/4 room cleave, similar to the Chain Deathmatch clones.
