A1: MK N | Braindead B2 | A2: Supp NW DPS SE | Clock Defams/Color Towers | Rot 6s
```
## Party Finder Terms

### "A1: MK N" / Mario Kart

Alarm Pheromones 1 will start in the north to begin baiting the bee lines. After the 4th line appears, move clockwise or counterclockwise around the arena. Make sure that you obey the pattern as the bees spawn in. Use judgment on best direction to go.

*Note: You may see the strategy "Melee N, Ranged S." Bait the first four lines in the center of the arena; afterward, only melee jobs move north, while ranged jobs move south. Both groups then rotate clockwise to dodge baits.*

### Braindead B2"

AKA: 1N0S  

Beat 2 0s start south, 1s north or away from the 0s. Rotate clockwise. Support NW Tower - DPS SE Tower.

### "A2: Supp NW DPS SE"

Puddle drop and light party stack priority: Supports in the North/West and DPS in the South/East safe spots.

### "Clock Defams/Color Towers">

Drop defamations at your clock spot. Soak the tower closest to your intercardinal pair marker.

### "Rot 6s" 

Activate the Rotten Bee debuff when there are 6 seconds remaining.
