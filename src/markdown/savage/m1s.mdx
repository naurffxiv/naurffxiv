## Party Finder Summary
```
TN | Same Bait Intercards | Supp CCW | THD | MTTT
```

## Party Finder Terms

### "TN"

Mechanics will be performed facing and using True North as the reference point. This applies to **Quadruple Crossing** and **Leaping One-Two Clone**.

### "Same Bait"

Proteans during Quadruple Crossing are always baited in the same spot on intercardinals, with DPS baiting the first set unless they have Nailchipper markers.

### "Supp CCW"

Supports rotate counterclockwise (CCW) to their pair and protean spot, and tanks rotate CCW to their light party (LP) stack at East and West.

### "THD"

Mouser 2 Protean Spreads are boss-relative, from left to right: Tank - Healer - DPS.

### "MTTT"

Raining Cats tether order: Melee - Tank - Tank - Tank. Tanks should heavily mitigate the second set of tethers and use invulnerability for the last two.
    
*Note: NA Party Finder mostly uses the [DiaStarvy MTTT Raidplan](<https://raidplan.io/plan/3Kfzojuys7fOQs1v>). Tanks will take the close bait, while the party takes the far bait. You may see groups using a slightly different strategy with the tanks not in light parties. View the Joonbob guide for an explanation.*
